 

CHAPTER XVI
Of the Edict of tlze Kinq, Bindinq leose Unaware of It

In times long past the question arose as to whether booty captured
by a general of the enemy after the sovereigns had signed a treaty of
peace really became the property of the captors, provided that the
generals did not know of the treaty. This same question arose and
was again discussed shortly before this present generation, and now
it is before us.

ἃ Now, my contention was that the booty could not have been
captured, or rather have become the enemy's who captured it. And
as it appears to us now, that question is quite idle for the following
reason: Clear and unmistakable stands the edict of the King, by
which any hostile action against the Spaniard is forbidden after
April 24, and after that day this capture of booty took place which 69
has now come up for judgment. And although the opposing side
might urge a very probable ignorance of the edIct‚ since they were
far away from here on the high seas, still, even without the edict and
in spite of their utter ignorance of it, the same principle of law seems
from our discussion mentioned above to hold good, and therefore
the same necessity of restoring the booty exists. bFor, though the
saying is current that the law is binding after two months have
elapsed, and that in consequence positive law may with impunity
(as it is aptly put in the Bm-chardica of Damasus) be ignored for
two months; cnevertheless the judge may decide at his discretion

· when the law becomes binding. dNow, the sovereign certainly had

the power to bind those unaware of the law, although no moral blame
or penalty would be attached to them. ‘'-Them too, it was his inten-
tion to bind those unaware of the law, since he indicated a day after
which men should be bound under it. This is the common view. We
are speaking now of an obligation that has no penalty attached.
fThose unaware of the law are not bound under penalty by the com-
prehensive terms of a statute taken in their fullest sense, for these
should the rather be narrowed in their application. Knowledge fol-
lowing the deed does not lead to punishment: even knowledge pre-
sumptive because general is not enough to bring the penalty even upon
a person in the place where the knowledge is general. Knowledge in
civil cases does not prejudice an absent person in any way. Other

statements to the same effect are found in the commentators‚ but they
