CHAPTER V

Whether It Is Lawful to Captzcre tlte Enemy in tlze Territory of
Another

It seems lawful to capture an enemy in the territory of another.
aWithout doubt it may be lawful to enter another's field for the
purpose of hunting wild beasts. Therefore, it may also be lawful
to enter another's territory for the purpose of hunting the enemy,
'³ for war is a hunt, 0 and a territory is nothing else than a domain.
Even if a man has entered a field against the will of the owner he
takes possession of his spoils. Suppose that the pursuit of the enemy
who is on the point of capture has begun in a territory where cap-

· ture is allowable, but that he has continued his ssight and been taken

in the territory of another? dIn the case of an offender who has
fied in this way and been captured, the legality of the capture is
maintained by Mynsingerus in the conclusions of the Imperial Chan-
cery on the authority of Angelus and others, e and this assertion may
be generalized in accordance with the rule that it is the lawful begin-
ning, not the unlawful end, that must be taken into consideration.
But this conclusion is false in the case of an enemy. fThis I
have shown in my books on war. The territory of another insures
safety, and when territory changes, control changes, etc. Further,
Baldus, Romanus, Alexander, ,Jason, and Cagnolus teach that an
offender who is taken in another’s territory, gmust be set free, even
if his flight began in territory where capture was allowable, inasmuch
as at the end the situation is different. ¹³ Cephalus says that even
a captive taken in the territory of an owner of lower rank may law-
fully be recovered from the territory of an owner of higher rank, and
that too, because the beginning of the pursuit there was lawful.
And to this effect he cites other doctors as well as Angelus whom
Mynsingerus mentions in support of his divergent opinion. But con-
sider further that it is of the disturber of the public peace

that Mynsingerus is speaking, Him it is lawful to take in another's 19

territory, and in this case Cephalus too agrees with him. But beyond
that case the remarks of Mynsingerus do not g0, as has been noted
in regard to them. iThis is what they say on that point, and other
German writers who express similar views say that he violates an-
other's territory who after beginning his pursuit lawfully makes a
capture in another’s territory. They say that he may be held for
