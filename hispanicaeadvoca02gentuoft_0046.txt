ture. ¹'And latent power can have the same effect as actual perform-
auce. But Ι have also replied to Cephalus in the aforesaid books and
Ι have refutetl this view of his, I think.

At this point I add that the question about pirates raised by
Cephalus ought to be considered different from our question about
legal enemies. The practice, too, in the case of wounded wild beasts,
a practice contrary to law, ought not to be extended to enemies, who,
let us suppose, have beached their ships on the shore of Corsica,
as these pirates did. To pirates and wild beasts no territory offers
safetv. g Pirates are the enemies of all men and are attacked by all
men 'with impunsty, etc. Similarly the hunting of wild beasts is unre-
stricted. Therefore, in the case of the pirates, we may say that they
could not have escaped‚ since they are always subject to capture
everywhere. But the same statement may not be made of enemies
who are not everywhere subject to capture, [for instance,] not with
a common friend. The Spaniards are not subject to capture by the
Dutch here in Great Britain, in France‚ in any other part of Christen-
dom. Consequently the Spaniards, even if captured, could escape in
many ways. hCould captives be captured? iBut when the law
says that a wild beast, whether wounded by us, or a captive escaping
from our custody‚ but still within our view and not hard to follow
up, has not recovered his natural liberty, it does not, therefore, also
say that it remains the property of the man who captured it. But
even if the creature did still belong to the hunter, provided it was
on the point of being taken without difficulty, it does not follow that
a creature on the point of being taken without difficulty is the same
as one taken. Undoubtedly it is always easier to keep a thing than
to get it.

Then this question of difficult pursuit must be examined in the
light of many a different hypothesis, but the examination will not
be furthered by supposing, as a certain solicitor absurdly pro-
posed to me, the recaptured Spanish ship put back in the place where
it was captured. Why, even in the case of a wild beast this practice
is not followed. kNor is it followed in the case where another
law says that Ι have not lost possession as soon as another person,
whom Ι will easily drive out, has entered my field with the intention
of taking possession. Does not the law, taking into consideration
the ease of expulsion‚ order judgment given in accordance with the
escorting into the field, even in the present circumstances?

¹ Hotomannus calls barbaric, though borrowed from the customs
of the Romans, the similar practice which the Germans applied in the
case of claims, while the Romans symbolized it by the power of the
rod of manumission and the joint laying on of hands.
