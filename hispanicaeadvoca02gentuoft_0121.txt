acquired. This is not the case with the Turks now, as everybody
surely knows, dd although Straccha may not have considered this in
setting down the opposite view, but his conclusion is in the very terms
of the law.

I add the fact, too, that if any of the articles which were being
carried for the use of the ship were left over, the English could
lawfully sell them. ⁹⁹ So, to speak of the things which can be pro-
vided merely for one's own use, it has been held that they may be
sold, if there is no use for them afterward.

By a fourth consideration I arn led to the same line of defense,
ff that the mere carriage of contraband is not such per se, but [it is
unlawful], because it would seem to assist in doing a wrong, that is,
in giving aid to the Turks. This assistance, since in this case it
would be many stages removed, would not imply irregularity, to say
nothing of any other criminal offense. Thus, for instance, the man
who furnishes a remote incentive to homicide would not be guilty of
an irregularity. This is literally the reply made by a man of clear
judgment and of eminent erudition and uprightness. To the
same effect Navarrus, who praises the man Ι have mentioned, lays
down the ruling that he who builds triremes for the Turks gives them
a very remote incentive to fight the Christians. But to serve on
Turkish triremes when they were warring against the Christians
would be to assist directly in doing wrong, and it has been so char-
acterized by the canon law. Carrying arms to the Turks would not 89
be a direct wrong nor a wrong at all in this sense, to adopt the dis-
tinctions which these very writers make in following others. Have
not the Turks today various wars amongst themselves, waged both
at the gates of the city and against the Persians? Now, to carry
such articles to the Turks as will be very probably used against the
Turks is not forbidden, gg for no one questions the lawfulness of
helping infidels against infideIS, as Navarrus and another very learned
Spanish scholar, Molina‚ remark. Christians may fight with the
Turks against those who are not Christians, Navarrus says, and
he remarks that we are within the law in helping thern against other
Turks. Consequently the possibility that the Turk might use these
munitions against the Christians is very remote indeed, for he is
rather far away from the Christians of that region where this ship
was or was going to be, and very far away from the Spaniards.
Besides, in this case we can defend the opinion of those who have
always said that a penalty is not incurred if these things are carried
with no intent of furthering an attack on Christians. The words of
the canon law indicate this, and Navarrus adds what has just been
said about assistance, although writers commonly offer another in-
terpretation of this law. &Vc ought not to depart more and still
