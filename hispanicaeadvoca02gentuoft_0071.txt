The Pleas of a Spanish Advocate, Bk. I. 43

is wrong when he says that Angelus can be defended for writing
that he who injures a scholar bidden to matriculate is punished as
if he had injured a matriculant. It is not true that Angelus can be
defended in a case of potentiality approaching actuality. tIndeed,
in the matter of punishments and of prejudicial cases, potentiality
approaching actuality is not regarded as actuality, as other writers
report, and as Baldus very properly says. He accepts the doctrine
which has been set down in the third argument giVen above, because
in the matter of punishments and of prejudicial cases language is to
be strictly interpreted. He also makes the general statement that a
man gets his characterizing appellation, not from that which he will
be, but from that which he is. They are not soldiers of the enemy,
although they will be. Here, too, this potentiality approaching actu-
ality does not exist. Here that “ straightway’' (confestim) does
not stand, as Ι shall show. Ι have spoken already of the man who
has been chosen and is journeying at public expense.

The fourth argument, which seemed to be more explicit, does not
create a difficulty, for on the one hand I do not find that dictum of
Castrensis ⁰ in my copies, and indeed it is not commonly held. So,
for instance, Χ Jason says about it: “ Paulus de Castro in a lecture,'’
etc. Alexander, who first reported this view, θ’ also writes that Cas-
trensis left the matter unsettled, although he inclines to this opinion.
Ζ Jason also says that he does not support it satisfactorily, and Alex-
ander adds that that would be a remarkable view, if it were true.
Indeed, Alexander himself maintains the opposite. ⁸²² Aretinus, aISO,
writes that the dictum of Castrensis is very doubtful, and he argues
vigorously against it. Even Socinus reports that his teachers (he
means Alexander and Aretinus) hold a view opposed to Castrensis.
Socinus himself also argues to the same effect, although he leaves the
matter to be thought over. m> Decius, also, has disagreed with Cas-
trensis; Socinus, too, quotes Baldus as opposed to Castrensis, but I
do not find that case in any one ccof the three lectures of Baldus,
‘¹⁶ and yet he, with other writers, as I have said, discusses this point in
quite vigorous terms. And so the definition of Castrensis has been most
effectually ruled out of court. The fact that others teach that a
man to be acquitted in the immediate future is regarded as acquitted
would not help him. To this Aretinus correctly replies that the
situation is not the same in the opposite case where conviction is
involved, for this is the prejudicial case in which punishment comes,
as I have said, while the other is beneficent, that is, it is a case
not leading to punishment. “ Prejudicial matters ought to have their
scope narrowed, benefits ought to have theirs extended,’' says the
rule. eecht makes a great difference whether you are inquiring
about the binding of a person or his liberation, etc.'' To this opinion
