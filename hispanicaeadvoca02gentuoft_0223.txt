be granted, not of an error in laW‚ but of an error in fact, and in
this case a review would be asked for, to see whether they could
take an action under the law. pThe fourth point is that recourse
may not be had to the Prince when there is not a strong, a very just
reason, a very great injury, a grave prejudice at stake, for he ought
not to be troubled by a small matter. But in the case of a delay
for a comparatively short time, granted to present proof at once
of their claim, grave prejudice is not involved. clIndeed, there
would be slight prejudice in granting a short postponement, the short
delay would not be a delay, etc. The fifth point is that a petition
has not been made for this review in wrsting, f and still in this case a
written document is said to be necessary. The sixth point is—what
will make the third parties satisfied—S the review will not suspend
the execution of the other decree obtained afterwards, under which
possession of the property, which had been decreed to us before, is
set down to their credit, and appeal from an interlocutory decree
does not hinder the judge from proceeding to final measures. tThe
seventh point, and this is explicitly taught, is that one does not
petition against an interlocutory decree, and a petition is not ac-
cepted even if the interlocutory decree cannot be remedied in a defini-
tive decree.

These points create a difficulty in the question and in our case.
Still since these arguments and others which could be adduced in sup-
port of this same position do not really stand in the way, I think that
a revision ought to be granted to us at once, and I am led to think so,
because if a petition is not prohibited in this case, surely it is per-
mitted, 1¹ for the petitioner asks nothing else than that the truth be
brought out, and if he has been injured, that the loss be made up to
him. Such a petition is in harmony with divine and natural law
and with equity‚ and therefore the Prince ought to grant it. This is
precisely the argument of Decianus, and there is a long discourse
there with reference to the peculiar duty of the Prince to establish
the truth. In the second place, Ι am led to exactly the same con-
clusion by the fact xthat it is lawful to petition against the injury
caused by an interlocutory decree, if (as is the case here) mention
be made also of the progress and status of the case, for a petition
seems to be forbidden to prevent deception. Furthermore‚ Salycetus
sets forth in detail, which “it suffices to give in abridged form‚'’ how
in such a suit, arising between such people, the judge had given an
interlocutory decree of this sort, and, injured by this interlocutory
decree from such a cause, he appealed to his royal majesty‚ that he
might petition him to grant an appeal. In the third place, Ι am in-
fluenced by the easy refutation of all the arguments on the other side,
so that what I said earlier of the permissibility of a petition which is
