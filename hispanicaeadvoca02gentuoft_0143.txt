CHAPTER XXIV

Of Inquisitions and the Testimony of Turks

With regard to ³ inquisitions the matter stands thus: They are
not held where money is concerned unless the truth cannot otherwise
be ascertained. Even in the case of slaves this is the established prac— 113
tice, and consequently they are not held even upon a man conditionally
free or in the case of other humble and obscure men. Free men
must not be tortured to convict them here of falsehood, nor yet to
arrive at the truth‚ unless they are said to be implicated in the deed and
they waver in their testimony. So say the laws; so say the doctors.
that then if our clients wavered? bThe nature of the proof
ought to be cogent, the details convincing‚ and so forth. ‘³ But then
this matter is said to be at the discretion of the judge and there is
nothing left for us to say since we did not see the procedure. d If
sufficient proof has not preceded, the confession which may have been
extorted under torture does not injure even those who have confessed‚
not even when they persevere in their confession. Always, however,
our presumption should favor the magistrate. But if men suspected
of perjury and accused of crime have already been tortured, all the
more shall we be able to understand that the magistrate had good
reason for his action. eThe Englishmen themselves, if convicted of
perjury, committed previously and without compulsion of torture,
should by all means be punished; but if convicted of perjury com-
mitted under torture they shall not be punished, since it was not in
deceit but in distress that they lied; f and where deceit is absent there
is no perjury. Their distress excuses them also for altering their tes-
timony, which is the same as perjury. Now, Ι say nothing here about
condoning these confessions. gThis question has been treated fully
by Menochius and others, but Ι assure you that Ι know well the stub-
bornness of the English which leads them to prefer every-
thing else, and even death itself‚ to torture3 while hon the other
hand, it is said of the Egyptians and Cappadocians that they would
rather die under inquisition than reveal the truth.

iThese confessions under torture surely do not injure the mer-
chants to whom the property was said to belong in the former testi-
mony. Nor could the testimony of the Turks hurt the merchants3
nay, it could not injure even the defendants themselves. kThe law 114
is quite definite on the point of not accepting witnesses of this sort
