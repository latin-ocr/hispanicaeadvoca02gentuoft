Translator’s Prefatory Remarks 1161

The Canon Law is very rarely cited by Gentili. When he has
occasion to refer to it, his method of citation is not unlike the method
which he follows with the Civil Law, that is, he quotes the opening
words of the main division to which reference is made. Now by
consulting the indices on pp. 1312-1339 of Vol. II of Friedberg’s
edition of the Corpus Iuris Canonici (Berlin, 1879-1881), the passage
sought may be found. Thus reference fff in the last chapter of the
Advocatio, c. ult. de aet. ἑά qual„ means Lib. Ι, Tit. 14, c. 15 of the
Decretals of Gregory IX; c. 2. dist. 77 in the same place means

Dist. LXXVII, c. 2 in the Decretum Gratiani.
The third class of citations is from commentaries on the Civil

or Canon Law and from treatises on legal subjects. The index of
authors cited, given at the end of this translation, will serve as a
key to these references. Thus (Advocatio I.1.c) Bar. alii l. 5. ξ. 1
means Bartolus and others on D. 49, 15, 5, 1, and in the same place
Bal. l. 8. C. de exe. re. jud. means Baldus on C. 7, 53, 8. An explana-
tion of certain other abbreviations will be found in the note preceding

the “geg-few cases the same proper name varies slightly in spelling

at different points in the Latin text. In the translation each of the
names in question has been given a uniform orthography.

ACKNOVVLEDGMENTS

The translator owes much to his friends and former pupils, Prof.
J. W. Cohoon of Mt. Allison University, and Mr. Arthur Williams‚
lately a colleague in this University, whose scholarship and critical
acumen have been of great assistance to him in solving many of
the difficulties which the obscure passages of Gentili’s work present.
Mr. XVilliams has also prepared the ¹Index of Authors and arranged
the references. To Dr. E. C. Richardson, of the Princeton Univer-
sity Libmry, he is indebted for assistance in bibliographical matters.
He is also under great obligation to Dr. Herbert F. Wright‚ of the
Carnegie Endowment, for a careful and helpful criticism of the book

while it was passing through the press.
