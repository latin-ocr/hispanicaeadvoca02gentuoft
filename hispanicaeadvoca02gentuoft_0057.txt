CHAPTER VII

lee Opinion of Arclzidiaconus with Reference to a Captiva» Con-
ducted tlzrouqlz a Clzurclz Is Examined

Against our defense given in the last chapter the advocates of
our opponent urged the opinion of Archidiaconus, which Ι have set
down there at the beginning and, as my adversaries have not done, I
have also supported his opinion by other evidence in the way of proofs
and of writers who assent. But first I have replied that the common
opinion is opposed to this view of Archidiaconus, a as, for instance,
Remigius states the common theory in his tractate ‘⁶ On the Immunity
of Churches.‘' bSimilarly Clarus says: “I say quite confidently
that if a man under sentence, while being taken to punishment, passes
through a church or a cemetery he may enjoy the immunity of the
church, nor may he be taken from there by force: and this is the
common doctrine.'' This doctrine too Johannes of hlonte-Sperello
held, ⁰ whom Bartholomaeus Socinus cites for me, ὁ and whom
Cornaeus also always mentions as distinguished, as a man of taste
and of very superior qualities, as eminent, as most upright‚ ‘³his
teacher, a man of most blameless judgment. Socinus reports that 27
the same view is held by the elder Marianusf whom Alexander calls
very distinguished and famous. And Bartholomaeus, himself a very
eminent and great jurisconsult, holds the same view. g Just as even his
own rival, Decius, names him, not to mention the testimony of others,
and the testimony of Mantua, who calls SocinuS, whom we have
mentioned, easily the leader among jurists. Even Mantua holds this
opinion, whom Decianus styles eminent and very illustrious, and
Decianus cites Mantua in his support. This position Johannes Vis-
chius, “On the Immunity of Churches,'' takes, not “seems to take‚''
as Decianus puts it, h and here in passing I may say that opinions of
learned men in their treatises are preferred to what is reported in
their other writings. iGonzalus Suarezius holds this view in his
treatise “On Ecclesiastical Usage,'' and he mentions another writer
also, and from Remigius he cites the common opInion, as Clarus does
too.

So we see it is the common view—a view which is held by nine
doctors, k although seven are enough. But I will add also Romanus,
Jason, and other writers, with the consent of Decianus. lThis is the
view which, as Chassaneus has noticed, is followed by the people of
