makes a distinction on noticing whether the contract is uncondi-
tional or conditional. In the latter case it would not be perfected
until the condition was satisfied. In the third process a contract is
not considered perfect until the property has been transferred„
Consequently, in the present inquiry a contract would be perfect in
the first particular, although, so far as the other two are concerned, 250
perhaps it would not be. It is enough that it should be perfect so far
as the first process goes to prevent a change of mind, says Decianus,
and he says that the reasoning is most effective. But I would say
that it is most ineffective, because in this case we raise the question
of the condition and the second process of perfectiori.

But he adds another reason, which one can not withstand‚ as he
says. This reason is opposed to that of Castrensis. It is that if the
parties concerned in contracting should say that they do not wish
to make the contract in writing, and that they wish the contract to be
regarded as perfected and finished, but that, however, they wish an
instrument to be made to give a clearer proof and a lasting record,
undoubtedly in this case the above-mentioned law will not apply.
Still the notary, when summoned, will set down the day.

He also adds a third reason to the effect that if in a contract,
for instance, covering a sale, an agreement to sell the property back
has been added and if it has been arranged unconditionally that an
instrument should be made to cover everything—and in this case
according to Castrensis the sale will not be called complete—if later
on an instrument of sale is made without including the agreement
to sell back, the buyer in his opinion can not be forced to sell the
property back, because before the completion of the instrument it
would have been lawful for the buyer at any time to change his
mind, and because the agreement can not be proved by witnesses.
Χ Both of these conclusions are incorrect, Decianus says, for on the
one hand an agreement can be proved by witnesses, and on the other
hand, the buyer can be sued when the agreement has been proved.
Consequently, the reasoning of Castrensis based on the instrument
is incorrect. It is undoubtedly incorrect. The aforementioned law
contractus ² does not establish his opinion.

Consequently, in this inquiry let us follow the opposite view which
is much better established, however, not by these arguments of Deci-
anus, but by the arguments mentioned above of Salycetus, to which Ι
think no good reply can be made. This view is supported also by the
well-known rule ythat in the case of contracts the interpretation 251
should be made against the man who takes his stand upon their words.
The interpretation is always in favor of the man who takes his stand
upon the promise.
