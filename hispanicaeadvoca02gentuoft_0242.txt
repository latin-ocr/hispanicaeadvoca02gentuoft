These considerations Ι regard as sufficient where the case is
clear; for what I brought forward with reference to an indefinite
price, namely that a sale is not recognized in this case, holds good
if the price is indefinite absolutely; k for what is definite in reality‚
even though it is indefinite to us, is sufficient. The price is definite
if we should find the words, “At what price you bought.’' Ac<
cordingly, here too the price is definite when mention has been made
of a sufficient sum received. That price is definite which is to be
fixed by someone’s valuation in the future; so that the price in this
case is all the more definite because it has already been named. ¹That
price is definite which is such through reference to something else.
¹¹¹ Then‚ too, it is definite even when reference has been made to a fair
price, since it must be so declared in the judgment of a good man, in
which there can be no indefiniteness. However, we are not here
bound to consider whether there is no sale in this case3 for at least
there is a transfer, which needs no price. ¹¹ There will always be con-
tracts where no price is named.

But the second argument regarding the revocation of the trus-
teeship does not affect my position, because there is more truth in the
view that the trustee who has received a permanent appointment can-
not be removed. OThis is verily the view of Felynus, and, finally,
this is the position taken by Baldus‚ p and this was the defense offered
by Albericus‚ and he says that he won his case. And whatever may
be true with reference to another trustee, qit is certainly true with
reference to a trustee of his own property that he cannot be removed,
and most certainly true with reference to the transference of rights;
rundoubtedly so, if Philip ordered the House of St. George not
to make the payments in favor of Peter. And yet we have, I
admit, to deal with that one case which alone is made an exception
by the laws of that House, for they make the revenues payable
to their owner always, and provide that they shall not be touched
by anyone else, “except in the one and only case, to wit, where and
when it is evident that this is done in accordance with the express
wish of the heirs.'' Manifestly we find here expressed the intention
of Peter who is not only the heir of those revenues, but is able to
dispose of them “ as he may wish,’‘ in accordance with the terms of
their establishment‚ and that expressly stated, not merely in accord-
ance with the common law, as I said before.

To this Ι add Sthat if the prohibition of alienation is prejudicial
and to be confined within narrow bounds, etc., how much the more
should it not be introduced? Those words, once applied to these
usufructuaries, “that they can receive yearly the revenues from the
places mentioned,'’ do not involve prohibition of an alienation made
so long before, but they show that these parties are the usufructuaries,
