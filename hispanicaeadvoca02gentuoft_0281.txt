lee Pleas of a Spanish Advocate‚ Bk. II. 253

the honor of his King he would be unwilling to depart from the
established law of nations, if your Royal Majesty approves.

Your Illustrious Lordship‚ Most U1priqlzt Judqe:

&Vc do not object to giving a bond, but we make two requests
in giving it: first, that a reasonable bond may be accepted, that is,
one for about the true value: secondly, that such bondsmen as can
be offered by his Lordship‚ the Ambassador, that is, by a sojourner,
be accepted. Now, on this latter point your most learned Lordship
knows that all expounders of the law always teach that even a jura·
tory bond (a privilege, however, which we do not ask for) ought to 254
be accepted, if a person, because he is a foreigner, is unable to
offer bondsmen. Now, this inability, as everybody thinks, is proved
by a mere oath, and that, indeed on account of an inability to give
bail, one may depend on a juratory bond is the practice followed
every day. Both of these opinions are held by Jason, on 1. Ι, Qui
satisdare coqantztr.² Arguing from parity we say that the bondsmen
whom his Lordship‚ the Ambassador, is able to offer ought to be
accepted.

Is tlte Statute Which Demands the Completion of Seventeen Years

¹³ The question is whether one who has entered on his seventeenth
year may be elected to a college, when the college has a statute which
speaks of electing him who has completed his seventeenth year. And
yet there seems to be no question at the first glance, for a year is
certainly not finished when we have merely its beginning. ²³³“ In
all things I note that that is perfect which is complete in all its
parts,'’ says the law,2 and other authorities make other statements to
the same effect. bb“That man is not considered to be seventy
years old who has entered on his seventieth year but has not yet
passed beyond it‚'’ says another law.3 And then to be so many years
old and to have completed so many years, are one and the same
ζ, thing, ⁰0 as another law4 joined to the one just mentioned points
Ϊξ, out. dd That is said to be complete which has such absolute perfec-
* tion that nothing at all is left over. Thus Decianus speaks in the

 

l light of these laws. That is full which is perfect and has no need
of any addition, etc. ee Although a day begun is regularly considered
ἶ as completed, yet a year begun is not regularly considered as com-

pleted, as Navarrus notes. He makes the reply too that that man
