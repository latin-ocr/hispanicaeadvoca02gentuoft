Of Immediate Proof

There are ²³ some who say that to offer proof at once and to
seek a short delay are the same thing. bYet, on the other hand,
others say that he who is under obligation to prove a point at once
must offer to prove it in exactly this manner. To offer, Ι say, to give
the proof within the limit of time which the judge may have as-
signed would not be enough; within the lawful time would not be
enough, for all delays ought to be lawful. ‘³ It is clear that when one
has instruments in his hands, and shows them without any delay, he,
as we say, furnishes a proof at once. dWe say that what is shown
in books opened before one does not require a somewhat careful
investigation. Therefore, this process would be furnishing proof
at once, since we see that a somewhat careful inquiry and this kind
of proof 316 by all writers placed in contrast. eTo give the proof
at once means to be ready within three days, even within ten days—
even within two months, provided the proofs are ready, but not
in the place of trial. f Or at once would mean within the time within
which a summary action, in which this proof would be presented,
might be finished; within the time within which the case at issue
might be finished. This is the common vieW, for the reason too, that
thus should be interpreted the saying that it is in the discretiori of
the judge to decide what immediate proof is, so that the judgeg
ought to limit his discretion in accordance with that which the law
intends and means. But the law would make it clear that what can
come within the time just mentioned can be proved at once. This
common view will be properly approved, because in individual cases
-h numerous and varied as they are—involving immediate proof,
¹likewise in those cases where 3 somewhat careful investigation is
required, the matter is more commonly settled under the power which
the judge has to exercise his discretion. Then by all authorities the
principle is recognized that the discretiori of the judge ought to be
governed by the law.

However, varying additions are made to the individual cases
from the law of those times—as one may see in Menochius-——and yet
in keeping with this general formula. k But this fact should be the
more observed that it is not immediate if witnesses have to be called

from beyond the mountains‚ says Innocent; from beyond the sea,
