”mm It ought not even to be said that it is a fictitious case when
a thing begun is taken as a thing completed, for since being regarded
as a certain thing is expressly and peculiarly provided in this case
as being a certain thing, they ought to be regarded as being on a
parity. These observations Ancharanus makes to the statute which
forbids anyone to hold a magistracy unless he be a native-born citizen,
so that Titius could be the magistrate, inasmuch as he was received
into citizenship with the proviso that he should be regarded as native-
born in all respects. But to this scruple about the legal fiction reply
has been made above also, so that it does not prejudice the case,
’‘¹³'‘ as the same Ancharanus and others (if anyone should have
urged the objection) say, that in the statutes it is not enough that a
thing should be regarded in a certain light, unless it is the very thing
which the statute requires.

Finally, it may be said here that the seventeenth year ought to be
counted from the last act of election, which follows the year of pro-
bation, when this young man will be several months beyond the
seventeenth year, for as to the fact that the law has a provision con-
cerning the age mentioned, and speaks of the very first step in the elec-
tion‚ still it does not say that this age should be required, and it says
that the electiori ought to be made in the manner and in the form and
in accordance with the provisions written below. And therefore—
and this ought to be noted—it makes one act of the whole election, in
which the approval and the year of approval are included. Still to
urge this is an act of supererogation, because the arguments already
given are far the most convincing.
