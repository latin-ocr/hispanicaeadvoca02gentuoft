lee Pleas of a Spanislz Advocate, Bk. I. 107

 

from robbers or pirates, as Caepolla, MenochiUS, and others teach. In
this case, as Menochius says, there is no place for the suspicion that
the buyer of the stolen property has been an accomplice, or has been
careless in looking into the status of the seller. These two consid-
erations underlie this law.

Furthermore‚ concerning a matter which is not even open to
doubt, this is more than enough. In fact, the conclusion would un-
doubtedly follow that possession, which we are not in the habit of
transferring even in the case of robbers, should not be transferred
in the case before us. ²³³ The right to possess even property stolen
and property held by force is recognized, even if ownership of it
cannot be acquired, for in such a case possession is not forbidden,
even if ownership is. bb On any other basis there would not even be
any claim to the possession of recovered property, so far as concerns

movable property which has been stolen or pilfered. ⁶⁰ The Vene-

tian has lost possession in consequence of the force used by a robber,
just as he might have lost it in consequence of an inundation. Pos-
session is also lost through theft. Now, we observe that in the case
of movable property, when fortune inflicts a loss on υς, our rights
under the law too are lost, so that no person may maintain that prop-
erty is retained for him, if he says <m that it was not his intention
to lose his claim under the law, but that it is not retained, even though
this claim be made, if the contrary be established. ΘΕ This position Ι
approve in the case before us, because the Venetians ought not to

have had such an expectation.
