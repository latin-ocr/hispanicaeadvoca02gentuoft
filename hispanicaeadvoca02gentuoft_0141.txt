The Pleas of a Spanish Advocate, Bk. I. 1 13

pirates. They are left outside. They are left beyond the reach of
any public complaint. Accordingly, they are left in the general
law which deals with infidelity and hostility. Then, too, no difficulty
is presented by the fact that goods seized by pirates do not become
their property; because this is true only of pirates who are not ene-
mies‚ and not of pirates who are likewise enemies. These pirates are
enemies‚ as I say, and the Turk along with them is an enemy of
the Venetians, since he protects those pirates openly everywhere
and always. But if the goods were certainly lost to the Venetians,
what grounds for displeasure have they, if Englishmen bought them?
00 Cannot each individual advantage himself while he is not injuring
others? Or is the Kingdom of England not free? pp The Venetians,
in answer to the complaint of the French King that gunpowder had
been bought at Venice and carried to his enemies‚ asserted that their
state was free and that no one was ever forbidden to trade there. Ι
likewise declare that my Englishmen are free and have not been
forbidden to trade anywhere. qq To secure what does not injure you
and advantages the other man should be the judge's continual aim,
and even the devil should get his due, as our countrymen say.

Ι shall add one thing more in conclusion. Our countrymen have
their trade with Tuuis, Algeria‚ and many another state taken from
them by this claim of the Venetians that those states are nothing
but piratical retreats and that there is none in thern but pirates and
that the very magistrates in them are pirates too. ‘¹ The Venetians
were incensed without measure at the traffic of the Lusitanians in

the Orient and at this traffic of our countrymen they are just as
incensed.
