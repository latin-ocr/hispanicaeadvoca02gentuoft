This recourse is of no avail in the case before us, ⁰⁰⁶ for the
navigator is covered more particularly than any other such person
with an agent’s power for the special reason involved in necessity
and greater utility, as the laws and the doctors observe. Besides,
the care of the “whole ” ship and, therefore, of the property, what-
ever it is, is committed to the navigator. But to the creditor and to
the usufructuary his own right, not that of the owner, is intrusted.
ddd Furthermore, possession, which has been intrusted to the navigator
and must be protected by him, is always a matter of small weight.
eeeObserve also that the knowledge and consent of the owners in
this case extend the right which the navigator had before, and give
him a fuller mandate to defend steadily what may be their right of
possession, which they know to be the only thing at stake. Thus in
this case the argument would be most effective that a verdict pro-
nounced against the navigator is understood to be pronounced as it
were against the agent, and therefore may clearly injure the owners,
and in this case the discussion concerning the transaction between
others would not arise, since the agent and the owner would be the
same person. fff The argument cited above then holds, when the per-
son is clearly another; ssgg when he is not clearly another, the verdict
pronounced between others does injure, hhh and it suffices if he be the
same by a fiction, as, for instance, a verdict pronounced against admin-
istrators injures their principals; ³³³ while a verdict even in part pro-
nounced against the defendant injures the owner to some extent as
well. But we in this present matter rather urge the mandate, kkk and
this would be a mandate not only extended‚ but also introduced, or
rather presumed to be that of one who knows and permits an action,
although he can prevent it, as the common opinion at least runs, and
the opinion confirmed by the decisions at Naples and Rome. And
yet Vasquius both calls the contrary view the common one, and de-
fends it by twelve arguments, and even by l. saepe,² where this case is
not found. But you will easily answer the arguments of Vasquius,
which concern either the rule or extrajudicial points.

¹¹¹ The fact is especially recognized in judicial matters that he
who keeps silent seems to agree, and this answer Bertrandus makes
in this connection, and he holds the view mentioned about the pre-
sumption of a mandate. mmm Similarly Menochius shows at length, in
his book “ On Presumptions,'' that we take it for granted that he who
keeps silent consentS, if “ this one condition '' is satisfied, that the per-
son-in question could have prevented the other from making a defense.
Th1s is true even when great loss is involved on the part of him who
keeps silent. whatever other view many have held on this point,
they were not correct. The situation is much more convincing, if
