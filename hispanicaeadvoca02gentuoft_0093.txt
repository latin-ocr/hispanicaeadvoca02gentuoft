CHAPTER XIV

Whether the Kinq May Riqlztfully Decide leat Spaniards leo Have
Been Routhy Handled by the Dutch off a Port of
the Kinq sllay Sail in Safety to Belqium

Ι think that our King has the undisputed right to let those
Spaniards go in safety who have recently been defeated in battle by
the Dutch and even attacked off a port of the King and are now
held under blockade in the harbor mentioned. Without any doubt
this action of the Dutch is in violation of all justice, and of the
respect which is due to the harbors and territories of another.
ὃ Indeed, no light injury is done to a man, if a person is killed or as-
saulted in his house or in front of it, as Nonius, a teacher of
mine, states in perfect accordance with the common feeling of
mankind. bconsequently‚ the Carthaginian leader abstained from
action against Scipio in the harbor of Syphax, when he was just clear-
ing his ships for action and yet could not have attacked Scipio before
he had taken refuge in the harbor, “and no one dared to engage in
actual hostilities in the harbor of the king,'’ Livy remarks. Acts
which violate a territory and a jurisdiction may not take place in
harbors, for, although the use of harbors is open to all, the abuse
of them is not permitted to anyone, an abuse which, in the case before
us, would involve the violation of jurisdiction and of the common
safety.

There is no question of doubt here, nor indeed can the heat
of battle excuse the Dutch, an excuse which perhaps somebody may
give even on the authority of my own books, in which he may have
read the following words: ⁰ ‘⁶ The anger of the enemy cannot be
curbed‚ nor his ardor cooled,'’ etc. dAnd elsewhere, “unthinking
heat is free from crime. A quarrel does not allow time for cool deliber-

61

ation. A man under the control of intense passion has not full control 62

of his mental powers,’' etc. These facts do not justify them, efor
in the very laws we read that anger, even when just, does not excuse
a man, except that he is to be punished less for what has been done in
anger. f In the case of misdeeds, there is no distinction whether they
have come from the heat of passion or not, because misdeeds ought
never to go unpunished. g The great Scipio, mild and ready to pardon
as he was, actually punished with death men of his who were to blame

for the pillaging of the city of Locha after he had sounded a recall
