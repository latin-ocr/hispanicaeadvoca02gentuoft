in dealing With a statute putting restrictions on receiving a foreigner
into a college, say that a man who is eminent in learning may be
received. yy In consideration of this preeminence and ability alm,
Alciatus makes many statements to the same effect elsewhere. But >
these matters, nevertheless, I do not mention, as if they would help
this youth, my client, and yet he—an unheard-of thing—was a
bachelor in his thirteenth year, as Ι shall show, ²² so much as to make
it clear that statutes are not to be interpreted harshly and that statutes

of this sort are not interpreted harshly.
Another statute provided that a man should not be received

into the college unless he were a citizen by birth. ²2³ The principle
is unanimously supported, and has on numerous occasions been adhered
to in practice, according to our authorities, that a man must be re·
ceived if his father is a native-born citizen, although he himself
chanced to be born elsewhere, for these statutes are to be taken in
this liberal sense. This is the view which Jason expresses after read-
ing, meditating, and adopting the views of the other most distin-
guished jurisconsults.

This is the view of others beside Jason, bbb and this opinion
Ripa calls the common one, although he asserts too that many hold
the contrary opinion, and he personally thinks that a distinction
should be made whether at least the man was conceived in the
state, because a man's conception is to be regarded as his birth in
cases beneficent for himself. Even this man, Ripa maintains, was
born in the state and should be admitted into the college, although
the statute admits none but the man born in the state. But the man
would be considered born in the state who by mere chance was born
outside of the state, especially if he was conceived within the state,
for this, the beneficent interpretation, is to be taken here. Ι shall
seize on this statement about the man conceived, ⁰⁶0 because if he is
regarded as born, in cases advantageous to himself, then this youth
likewise can scarcely lack anything of having passed beyond his
seventeenth year. Others count the age from conception in their dis-
cussion of minors, (Μ and they are refuted in that case solely be-
cause the edict regarding minors speaks expressly of those who have
been born, ‘³2²³ and in the discussion it would have been prejudicial
that one conceived should be regarded as one already born, as my
teacher, Oddus, replies; for in this case the periods for restitution
would be shorter. And so in the same discussion the twenty-fifth year,
although only begun, is regarded as completed. {ff In some cases the
years are counted from infancy, and elsewhere otherwise.

But one point more, another statute decreed that no one should

be admitted into the college unless his grandfather was a native-born
citizen. gggA man whose grandfather was born elsewhere, although
