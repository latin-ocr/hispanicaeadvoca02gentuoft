“ movable '’ property, but only determines where an effective seizure
may be made; so that this view is not only the one more approved,
as Caravitta writes, but it is also without doubt the common one.
⁵ XVhatever the writer mentioned holds, Baldus would like to set up
the opposite opinion in the Libri Feztdorum, tand in this opposite
position Alexander, also, would seem to take his stand, as does Mo-
linaeus in his notes on Alexander.

¹¹ Now Clarus says that in practice he has never seen the former
opinion of Baldus followed. But this view of Clarus amounts to
nothing: for he does not say either that he has seen his later opinion
followed. Χ And yet through the non-occurrence of a usage, a purely
negative consideration, and therefore, not implying an act contrary
to the law, the law is not abrogated, ynor would Clarus reach any
conclusion if he had made the statement concerning regions beyond
those known to him and concerning times beyond his own. zI won-
der that Bursatus has not noticed this, but, relying merely on these
remarks of Clarus, he actually holds an opinion contrary to the com—
mon view; and takes a scornful attitude, although he indeed states
the common view and talks about other views; so that, perhaps,
³³ what another very learned man urges against him may be true,
that he is in the habit of collecting his authorities without making any
choice between them.

So far as Alexander goes, he does not firmly hold the later opin-
ion of Baldus and quotes it only once, bb although he states the earlier
opinion vigorously several times. With reference to Molinaeus, who
refers to other works of his own, I would say nothing now, because
I have not those works. Yet if one person teaches a doctrine, why
should that influence us against the common opinIOn of so many
writers, and how does Baldus himself reach the conclusion that
the ownership of “ movable ’‘ articles is decided by territory,
since, as he himself states in his feudal law, such articles are
confiscated by the people of a territory? ⁰⁰ They are turned over
to the people to plunder, as other writers put it. The law speaks
both of the sovereign who confiscates in that region, of the sovereign
in whose territory this “movable’' property has been confiscated,
and of him who is judge of the person suffering confiscation. SO,
naturally, that property would belong to the same territory as does
the person whom the goods concern, as has been stated in the earlier
opinion of Baldus. So Baldus comments correctly on that law, and
so we shall understand him in accordance with the law on which he
is remarking and which he cites. This ought always to be done in a
doubtful case. So we shall also understand the others, who have
followed Baldus here, in accordance with the authority of Baldus
which they cite. This, likewise, ought always to be done, dd even if
