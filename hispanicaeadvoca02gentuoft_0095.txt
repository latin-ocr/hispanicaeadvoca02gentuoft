The Pleas of a Spanislz Advocate, Bk. I. 67

followed on that former occasion with the French ship mentioned
above. She was allowed to go in advance of the other vessel during
one entire ebb and flow of the sea. There is a great similarity between
these cases, and the line of reasoning involved is similar.

rThe blockaded man is a man held captive and is so styled‚
At the present moment the Spaniards are blockaded here where they
ought not to have been blockaded. Consequently, they ought to be
set free and allowed to go. The Dutch have no defense in the
word “blockade‚“ and the smoke furnishes them no valid excuse,
for this reason, not to mention others, because in all cases the sov-
ereign right of jurisdiction is defended and vindicated if violated.
SIt would be a wrong to us, I repeat it, if in our house a person
should be taken prisoner and therefore it is a wrong if a person
is blockaded.

t It is for the Prince too not only to guarantee that people live
securely and safely everywhere in his territory, but without doubt it
is for him also to punish offenses committed against all others as well
as against himself. ‘¹ Now, there are several cases when one party
deals with another, that the second party may deal with a third. “ Ι
take action that you may take action,'' as our saying goes. For this
reason, then, the Spaniards will bring action before the King, if
Princes owe security under the common law to everybody in their
realms. Furthermore, our King owes it to the Spaniards under the
special legal right which the recent peace established. In the case
before us the Spaniards have been wronged by being attacked off the
harbor; in the case before us they are suffering injury by being block-
aded in the harbor. They are seeking redress; they are asking a
friendly and allied King, who did not have to be injured and yet was
injured, to punish the deed. This happened within the jurisdiction of
the great Admiralty. X Consequently, a serious offense has been corn-
mitted against its jurisdiction. Action is not brought to have the
King help one ally against another, but to have him prevent the use
of any violence upon one by the other within the King's jurisdiction,
yalthough the doctrine has been handed down in a parallel case in-
volving allies, that one should be defended against the attack of the
other.

But it is not real redress, if, as I hear proposed, these Span-
iards are taken back to Spain, for this is what the Dutchman would
like, and he would pay a high price for it. He would even build a
golden bridge for the fleeing enemy, as the saying goes. Ζ Redress is
that which pains, not that which pleases. Redress should hinder,
not help. But it would help the Dutch to have the Spaniards sent to
their distant fatherland‚ to have them removed from this convenient
place where they could stay and from which the completion of their
