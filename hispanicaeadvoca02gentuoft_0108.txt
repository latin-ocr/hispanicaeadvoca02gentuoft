CHAPTER XVIII
Of an Ambassador Actinq for the Subyects of His Kinq

The objection has often been raised that an ambassador cannot
manage the cases of his King's subjects, and people add that the
alowly task of managing lawsuits belongs to the deputy, but is be-
neath the dignity of an ambassador. bAn ambassador, they say,
should have nothing to do with business affairs, whether his own or
another’s. But our position is this. Accursius and others do indeed
call the office of deputy a burden, cand certain individuals charac-
terize it as a lowly and disreputable office, but the law appears to make
this statement of the deputy with reference to his business duties,
not with reference to lawsuits. Then in other cases too that objec-
tion does not hold. dV‘Vell, is it not a high honor to be the deputy
of a sovereign? Even the King's notary is in high honor, although

75 the notary at other times is an insignificant person. eWhatever is
imposed by the sovereign is a high honor. Mark the ennobling law,
says Andreas de Bamlo. fThen in the case of learned deputies,
when they even have a college, the reproach is unmerited.

ἓἎΤεΙΙ, are ambassadors not nuncios? hAre they not holders
of a trust? Again, the ambassador in this case fills the office of
deputy in precisely the same way as a sovereign, even the highest,
does when he appoints a deputy and does not appear at the bar in
person. iIn this way “the task does not make a heavy demand,''
and the ambassador could perform it. Even before the suit is
entered he can appoint a deputy, who by no means has to corne into
court, and who has this privilege because he has not become the
owner by attesting. Why are these objections raised to a deputy with
such an honorable commission? Is the commission demanded? k He
is not forced to show it. But I show from the law ¹that a sovereign
is in duty bound to defend and care for his subjects and their prop-
erty. Therefore his ambassador too would be bound to take this
care of his sovereign's subjects and the property of his sovereign’s
subjects‚ since the ambassador stands in the place of his sovereign.

¹¹¹ Further‚ I have shown in my books “ On Embassies‚'' and others
following me in this field have shown, that these private interests
too come under the care of ambassadors. ‘¹ Resides, an ambassador
just like anyone else can intervene here in the defense even of prop-

erty, and to the extent of taking the matter into court3 here especially,
