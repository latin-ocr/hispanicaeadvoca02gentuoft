The Pleas of a Spanish Advocate‚ Bk. II. 227

On other points they offered strong opposition and harassed
us greatly, and yet without sufficient judgment. They took exception
to the bondsmen whom your most Illustrious Excellency had sent
and whom the judge had accepted. Here the judge did indeed favor
them somewhat, for he not only suspended his decree concerning
the bondsmen accepted, but even revoked it, and ordered others to
be offered. As soon as other bondsmen had been produced and
the judge would have accepted them, the other side appealed to his
Majesty, alleging that these bondsmen were not satisfactory either.
The opposing side did not act wisely here, although the judge took
two days, has he had the right, for deciding whether the appeal
should be allowed. The opposing side erred in making the unjust
and injurious allegation that the bondsmen were not satisfactory,
though it might have said honestly ithat the security was not given
in a satisfactory way, since it could not have insured the restoration of a
third of the property without delay. However, since this inconven-
ience was not sufficiently provided against in my opinion even by our
representative, Ι should have provided against it and lent my assist-
ance by a brief exercise of authority, had there been any need. But
on this point there was deep silence.

Then, too, there was silence on the question whether the bondsmen
were effectively bound under the common law of England‚ as I hear
from the subtle Bernardus. k Further, they are not bound with enough
effectiveness to comply with the English civil law, since they were not
present and did not ratify their acceptance of the position of bonds-
men when finally the judge decided that an appeal should not be
admitted: for their obligation was suspended by the appeal and by
the judge‘s announcement that he would consider. And yet Ι provided
for this thing. I ordered the bondsmen to be on hand, in case they
should be called, to renew their security. But when my opponents
had appealed from the acceptance of the bondsmen and the judge
had not admitted the appeal, why had they not shown that it was
the law that the appeal should be admitted, or why did they not ap-
peal from its non-admission? They should have done this or Ι give
up the law. They cannot be excused. An appeal is taken from the
acceptance of bondsmen, of witnesses‚ etc. To my two proposals
on the other side they might so far have replied in two ways; that
the acceptance of bondsmen was not at the discretion of the judge,
and that even in these discretionary cases an appeal might be taken.

Among the many things that excited my surprise was the fact
that they proved unable to cause us trouble for a longer time, and
this was the one thing they wanted; that they did not bring forward
documents, as they might have done, to combat my documents, and
that, in one word, they did everything else. Then, too, they chal-
