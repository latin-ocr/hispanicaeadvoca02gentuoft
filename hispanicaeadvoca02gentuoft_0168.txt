not apply. Then‚ too, Ι do not even find that opinion in Hostiensis
and in Butrius in the passage on c. J, De testibus,l which Felynus cites.
But in general it would not apply, nor would this assertion be made
by Felynus in the case when it is lawful even to bribe a witness, for
would anyone refuse to give evidence in the presence of a judge who
caneuse compulsion, unless he is led to do so by a bribe? Menochius
expresses himself to this effect: “ But here there will be need of care
on the part of the judge in making an examination, and in deciding,
from the standing of the person concerned and the sum of money
given, whether it is probable that it was given by way of pay for labor
and expenses‚'' and in this situation Menochius wishes to have it possi-
ble to give more, and he grants the judge discretion about what has
been given, although he does not propose that he have discretion about
what is to be given.
