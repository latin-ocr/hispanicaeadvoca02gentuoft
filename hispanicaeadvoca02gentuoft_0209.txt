The Pleas of a Spanish Advocate, Bk. II. 181

coursing on these many conditions which were said by him to be re-
quired to the end that a verdict might injure another person, on
his point concerning the defendant writes to this effect: “ It is clear
that a defendant has been present in a case where many have ap-
peared and contended very vigorously for admission to the division
of property which others were hoping for, while no verdict pro-
nounced against the first parties stood in the way.’' The legal de-
fendant mentioned by Alexander is required in case the suit, on
account of its own'character, must and can prejudice. thhers, as
well as Alexander himself, add this condition. Similarly Imola aptly
applies this condition to a case of this sort. As for Alexander, in a
confused way, as applying to these three or more cases of a verdict
which injureS, he mentions both this point about the legal defendant
and eight other points, as one sees at the very beginning of his nar-
rative. Now, it is very clear to one who looks into the matter at-
tentively that all these nine are not required for each case individu-
ally. There is a fourth case in Covarruvias when a verdict injures
the third party because of some single result, and with this case and
with the third case what have the most of their nine points to do?
Γ that has the knowledge mentioned to do with the first kind? The
case where knowledge is required calls simply for a common knowl-
edge, in the present instance on the part of the defendant, as I just
now remarked, in quoting from Menochius and others. §When the
verdict touches the third party “in no wise,'’ then (says the doctor
quoted by me) it would be absurd to say that even in conse-
quence of the citation itself the third party would be prejudiced.
t Furthermore‚ the bond of interest is established through either the
persons or the cases, or the matters involved. ²¹ These three ought to
co-exist that an exception to a res iudicata may stand: the same thing
in dispute, the same cause for seeking redress, the same condition on
the part of the persons involved. Now, in the case before us the
first link exists, for the navigator has charge from the owners. The
second one exists, because the owners are themselves obliged to de-
fend the suit in the same way in which the navigator defended it.
The third exists because the things in dispute are the same in this
case.

Now, on the first argument no one may say to me Χ that a ver-
dict pronounced against a tenant does not injure the owner in whose
name he holds possession, and, therefore, a verdict which has been
pronounced against the master of a ship would not injure the own-
ers, Υ for he is hired, as it were, ² and those hired hold possession,
not for themselves. but for owners. ³³ XVhere different persons are
involved, in that case a verdict does not injure any other person than
the one against whom it has been pronounced, even if one and the
