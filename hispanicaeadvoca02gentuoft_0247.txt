lee Pleas of a Spanislz Advocate‚ Bk. II. 219

and their concerns, what third person should thrust himself in behalf
of the rights of a third!

’Tis a sufficient reply to the opposing side to say that an am-
bassador has a free house, as the proverbial saying is among the
jurists. I add—which is, however, superfluous—that the authority
of the ambassador, which is the authority of his sovereign, extends
also to the cases of private individuals, if the authority of their
sovereign extends so far. Further‚ those who write about the ambas-
sador or embassies, do not fail to write this warning, that an am-
bassador should always help the friends of his sovereign with all
his energy and all his attention. The more, therefore, will they say
that he should assist the subjects of his sovereign, and do we not see
that all ambassadors have a great deal to do with these suits of
private individuals? Then, too, those writers maintain that the
ambassador should be believed when he tells what is in the contract3
and they certainly write the truth with reference to these less impor-
tant, probable, and ordinary matters, But, as I said, these cases
abound where the ambassador has to deal with other litigants than
those who have to enter suit regarding a contract.

The opposing side has nothing here to contradict. The price
estimated is even more than a fair one, because the ownership of the
sugar is contested and, therefore, of so much the less value. This
is the view given by the doctors. Had the valuators taken this into
consideration, or rather been bound to take it into consideration,
they certainly would have made their valuation lower. Then has
not the fullest consideration been given to the interests of the oppos-
ing side? If it wins the case, it will receive double that valuation‚ if
the property itself cannot be restored. Such is the bond. Conse-
quently, his XVorship, the judge, sees how unreasonable our oppon-
ents are. They wish the ambassador to lose his rights, or themselves
the property, forsooth, just like the woman who said to Solomon,
“ Let it be neither mine, nor hers.'' Do you play the part of Solo·
mon, your Worship. Do not let the stuff be spoiled. Put an end to
these and all other delays. Besides, there will be no opportunity
here for an appeal against your decision, where we have to deal with
goods that will deteriorate and be ruined through delay. The in-
terests of the opposing side have been safeguarded more than suffi-
ciently. There may be an appeal taken in other cases, but not here.
In other cases the valuation would not necessarily be accepted in the
award, but it would be accepted here where it was made by the rep-
resentatives of the parties concerned and, tacitly, at least, approved.
Here it should be accepted in the award in order that goods which
suffer from delay may not be subJect thereto. Such are my argu—
ments, apart from any proofs that may be advanced by a man learned
in all the branches, and after other proofs given yesterday.
