of witnesses.'' Thus Fulgosius expresses himself in the single case
of witnesses, and even in that case he does not wisely depart from
the common opinion, since (eas Bartolus and Baldus explicitly
respond) the admission of witnesses always creates a certain preju-
dice. f Furthermore, even from the slightest injury one may appeal.
gAn appeal is taken from an interlocutory decree, “the proof of
which can bring prejudice or the injury from which cannot be done
away with or repaired in an 399631 from a definitive decree,‘’ says
Romanus. Baldus in addition notes several cases of appeal which
are lawful in this connection: when the interlocutory decree brings
an execution with it; when it excludes proof; when it changes 3 benefit.
These cases fit our situation very well, since to our detriment the
execution of the judgment which has begun is stopped by the admis-
sion mentioned; we also are prevented from proving that they are
not third parties But I hold that an irreparable injury results from
this admission, and from any other admission of persons, hbecause,
as Baldus shows, when once admitted, they can never be rejected
again, either in the hearing of an 399631 or in an action for owner-
ship. Thus it would not oppose my argument, if anyone should allege

ithat an interlocutory decree may be recalled by the judge to whom

399631 has been taken from the definitive decree, because the power
to recall all interlocutory decrees is reposed in him. There is no
difficulty in this first question, where the opinions are common and the
reasons clear.

In the other question several points create a difficulty, ¹< although
a revision is called an appeal of a certain kind, and ought to be con-
sidered in the nature of an appeal. In the first place, a difficulty
arises, lbecause while a suit is pending 3 petition for a review would
not be lawful, and an interlocutory decree does not interrupt a suit,
nor does a suit cease to pend in consequence of an appeal——at least
not in consequence of an appeal from an interlocutory decree, ¹¹³ what-
ever may be true to the contrary in the case of a definitive decree.
The laws are clear: “To petition while the case is pending is not
lawful, unless the publication either of the proceedings between the

parties or of the decision be denied.’' Here, then, two cases only
are excepted, and ours is not one of them. Further: “He who has

failed to make a lawful appeal must forever keep silence, nor ought
he impudently to ask aid of us by a petition, etc.’' Secondly, where
there would exist the ordinary remedy of an appeal, the extraordi-
nary remedy of a petition would not hold. This is also the general
rule, and here there is a place undoubtedly for an appeal, as I have
said, and it is not lawful to neglect it, as we have heard. 11Α peti-
tion is never admitted where an application can be made. This is
the teaching of the doctors. 0 The third point is that a review would
