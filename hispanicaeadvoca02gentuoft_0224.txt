not forbidden would follow. No difficulty then would arise from the
first point which involves a rule that would not hold here, inasmuch as
the case is an exception, although it is not one of the two exceptions

in the law, for other cases also are made exceptions by the doctors,
yand this case of ours, where an interlocutory decree cannot be

remedied by a subsequent definitive decree, is thus one of the other
exceptions. It is lawful also to petition, while a suit is pending, that
another judge be associated with the judge who is under suspicion.

193 ² This view another law and all the doctors support. This is the peti-
tion made in this case to the Prince that at least other judges may be
associated with a judge who is under grave suspicion. In this case
an appeal is not neglected‚ but it is added to the petition in accord-
ance with the formula of Salycetus for securing the assignment of
persons.

The second difficulty does not stand in the way, because it has
been solved by the teachings of Salycetus and of others who com-
bine in this case the petition and the appeal. ³³ The ordinary general
recourse and the extraordinary special one are taken as remedies at
the same time. BesideS, the extraordinary remedy is not a mere
subsidiary remedy, and the extraordinary remedy tends to support
also the ordinary one, etc. bb So the ability to appeal does not hinder
restoration to the former state, as the common opinion runs. Like-
wise failure to make an appeal does not. Thus the second argument
on the other side does not stand in the way. Now, as to the fact that
a petition may never be accepted when an appeal can be made, it is
true that that is the common dictum, and usually held, not always, and
the doctors, cited by Maranta‚ do not hold refusal in that case as
the uniform procedure. ‘³0 Panormitanus says that anyone may
apply by way of precaution the double remedy of an appeal and
of a petition, when he is in doubt as to which is in place. In
the present case this may be said to have been done with perfect
propriety.

The third argument on the other side would not stand in the
way, because inquiry is made about a very serious error in fact in
this case where people have been admitted as third parties, who are
not third parties, but identical with the former litigant. dd Further-
more, as to the denial of an error in administering justice in this case,
that is said with reference to a Prince, for a peculiar position is at-
tributed to him, since it is taken for granted that he who has all jus-
tice locked in his breast does not err in administering justice. ee The
law shrinks from hearing injustice spoken of in the case of such great
men. It admits the possibility of an error in fact, from which an
error in justice has followed. ff It admits the error in fact, although

194 some injustice even may seem to follow from such an error also: no
