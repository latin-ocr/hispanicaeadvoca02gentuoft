 

THE CLASSICS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW

This series, which includes the classic works connected with the history and develop-
ment of international law, was undertaken by the Carnegie Institution of Washington
*in 1906, at the suggestion of Mr. James Brown Scott, then Solicitor for the Department
of State, under whose supervision as General Editor the series has since been published.
On January 1, 1917, the project was transferred to the Carnegie Endowment for Inter-
national Peace and the publication of the series is being continued by the Endowment's
Division of International Law, of which the General Editor of the Classics is the

Director.

The republication of these classics has been undertaken principally on account of
the difficulty of procuring the texts in convenient form for scientific study. The text of
each author is reproduced photographically‚ so as to lay the source before the reader
without the mistakes which creep into a newly printed text. An introduction is prefixed
to each work, giving the necessary biographical details concerning its author and stating
the importance of the text and its place in international law. Tables of errata in the
original are added when necessary, and notes to clear up doubts and ambiguities or to
correct mistakes in the text are supplied. Each of the Classics is specially edited by an
expert in international law and is accompanied by an English version made expressly
for the series by a competent translator.

The following works have appeared and are now on sale. The price is indicated
for each work. They can be obtained by remittance to the publishers, either the Claren—
don Press, Oxford, England, or the Oxford University Press, American Branch, 35 &Vest
32d Street, New York, N. Y„ who are the regular selling agents for the Clarendon
Press in this country.
