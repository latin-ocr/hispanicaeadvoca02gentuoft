CHAPTER XXV
Of Commerce with tlze Turks

aAll the laws apparently say that commerce with the Turks is
forbidden. I, however, do not care lightly to depart from the very
definite rule of the law of nations bwhich regulated trade relations
without making any distinction between nations. Now, other laws
could offer no difficulty; they can be answered in many ways, and
always truly. Those laWS, whether civil or canon, do not affect the
subjects of England, except in this way, that the English are not
allowed to have the trade relations mentioned with the enemies of
the Roman Empire; these laws do not so affect the English as to
make it just as unlawful for them to trade with the enemies of others
as with the enemies of England herself. ‘³ Add that between princes
and also—and this is our case—between a prince and the subject of 115
another nation it is the practice that the civil law should not apply
but rather the law of nations alone. Or why should those laws which
are now under discussion be heeded when they are no longer in force,
but are dead, abrogated by opposite usage? See, I have given two
replies. The third is that our King approves of the commerce, and,
accordingly, it will be just as lawful as if the man who issued those
laws were now to approve personally of the commerce and order
his laws to remain in abeyance. The fourth reply is that the Eng-
lishmen were merely on the way3 they had not yet completed the
transaction. The fifth reply is that this act is very many steps re-
moved from being of any direct help to the Turks, and that there-
fore this trade would not be forbidden. The sixth reply is that it
is not possible to see any evil intent here on the part of our clients
against the Tuscans or other Christians. The seventh reply 1s that
it is conveyance to the Turks that 1s forbidden, but this 1s a case of
conveyance from the Turks, the transport of Turkish merchants
clwhere gold is taken from them through the action of the civil law.
The eighth reply is that we are not here dealing with goods or
merchandise that is contraband. The ninth is that this is not a state
of war which exists between Tuscany and Turkey; they are merely
raiding against one another. eWar is a lawful struggle and a
struggle in the full sense of the term.
The tenth reply is one that will overwhelm every opposing
argument as with a monster wave, that the Tuscan in his wisdom
