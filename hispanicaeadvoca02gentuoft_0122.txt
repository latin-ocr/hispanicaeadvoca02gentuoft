more from the words [of a law], but we ought to return more and still
more to them.

In our case the view mentioned above, which is in harmony with
the letter of the law, can be the better defended, since, in comparison
with the other merchandise, that which is called unlawful amounts to
almost nothing. There would be very little of it, what you might
call a makeweight, hh and a makeweight is not considerable, so as
to vitiate or alter completely the character of the main cargo. The
greater and the beneficial, claims the judge's attention, not the less
and the prejudicial. In this case I say that the powder was a make-
weight; I say that the iron was, and I make this assertion for the very
reason that it was put on board in the customary manner as ballast to
steady the ship. In our case that view can be the more defended because
the English actually wished to sell to the Spaniards, and everything
was intended for another place, and for a place besides, where they
had a right to take it.

Clearly, therefore, the innocent purpose of the merchants is
evident, still, in view of their purpose, so far as it is inferred from
the carriage of contraband, the carriers are liable to punishment. In
the case of these articles which are absolute contraband, the evil
intent which I have mentioned is taken for granted, they say. iiStill‚
as Navarrus remarks, this is not the presumption of the law and in
accordance with the law. Suppose farmers, who would not think these
articles contraband, were carrying thern. Navarrus thinks that they
are excusable. Why do we not form the same favorable judgment
in the case of these merchants who would without doubt have thought
that they were not forbidden to use these articles, which were a
makeweight in getting ballast, which were taken in very small quanti-
ties, and would very probably be used against other Turks. It
was even lawful to take them to the Turks under the orders in council
of Queen Elizabeth. The English know and follow these laws of
their native land. They do not know other laws; they do not know
the canon laws mentioned above, which have actually disappeared in
England. Shall I say, in England, or everywhere? kk At all eventS,
our doctors write without reserve that those admirable articles of
the civil law, which we have cited above, are not followed. So,
then, we have had the fourth argument, that, when the evil intent
mentioned above is not shown, the penalties involved do not apply
to these merchants.

The fifth argument is likewise drawn from Suarezius wh0‚ as
I have mentioned, wrote on a case parallel to ours. He says that
people who carry such cargoes are always exonerated, provided they
have made a manifest with an official, ¹¹ and his authority is Bartolus.
But the Englishmen in our case have made a manifest of these ar-
