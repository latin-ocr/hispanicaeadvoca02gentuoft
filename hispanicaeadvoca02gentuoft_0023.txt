Dedicatory Letter v

to whom is the writing of Spanish pleas undertaken in foreign
realms more properly due than to the Spanish ambassador? To [viii]
whom is a book containing pleas made for Spaniards in the
Royal Council Chamber more properly due than to the spokes-

man of the mighty King of the Spains at the Court of his Im-
perial Majesty? Under whose protection should this book take
refuge if not under the protection of him who sprang from that
family to which the man belonged who gave this book its in-
spiration and life? To crown all, is your remarkable kindness
which leads everyone to love and cherish you, a kindness to
which are joined matchless virtues and the greatest distinction.

We have ourselves often seen you in this great and most illustri-

ous imperial City of NurembergÍ¾ and seeing you, we seemed

to behold the mighty king himself, as it were, and the mighty
power of Spain. What else is an ambassador than the life and

face of him by whom he has been sent and whose person for

that reason he presents to us, as we believe. May all good fortune
attend your most illustrious Excellency, and may you deign to [ix]
look with a kindly eye upon this token of my respect.

Dated at Nuremherq, February I, 1013.
