mitanus? And in begging the question he takes a stupid course.
Even the other point 5 which other writers also have is not apposite,
129 that Pollianus in that case is not a true witness, for even if the doctors
regularly write that in this law it is laid down that the testamentary
disposition, based on the unspoken wish of the other person, is valid
because of the special favor shown the dower right—and so Pollianus
would not be a true witness—still this interpretation is absurd. Ζ Alci-
atus shows this, and the fact is clear today to all who know the ab·
surd explanation of the captatory disposition of property given by
all the old interpreters who say that an arrangement which has been
based on the wish of the other person is captatory. Resides, it is
very silly for Menochius and Covarruvias to say that in quite a large
number of emended manuscripts the reading is not iuratus scripsit
(he put it in writing after taking the oath) but roqatus respondit
(he replied when questioned). Covarruvias says that iuratus scripsit
can even be explained as propria manu subscripsit (he signed with
his own hand), or that the discussion in that connection does not con-
cern a witness who deposes with the solemnity which accompanies
judicia] procedure. This last point is the same point as the first one
of Panormitanus, and it is besides disproved by these words of the
law, i.e., pro marito iuratus. Aretinus foolishly explains thern as
meaning in the presence of the husband, outside the courtroom,
a marito puellae iuratus (having been sworn by the husband of the
girl). These proceedings are conducted in the courtroom, since it is
always the custom to administer an oath to a witness in the courtroom,
not outside it. Likewise also it is disproved by these words, eum cuius
notio est aestimatur-um (he who conducts the examination will
estimate). They indicate that the transaction takes place in the
courtroom, if they have not been put in tautologically by Scaevola.
*Ἥ Pollianus is a true witness also. All of them call him every-
where a witness, and no reason can be given why he should not
be so considered. Thus the opinion of Bartolus is on my side. In
support of which I add that the Venetians are said to observe the
practice regularly of having a witness give his testimony in writing, as
he who added the supplements to panormitanus bears witness. In this
connection, in point of fact, Ludovicus Romanus says that the usage of
a place may make valid a method of proof which is invalid under the
law. m> In the Kingdorn of Bohemia, in the Archduchy of Austria, in
Bavaria‚ and elsewhere the practice prevails of allowing noble and
130 distinguished persons to send to the judge a written and sealed docu-
ment attested by them. We understand that this method of giving
evidence is not objectionable. What was the usage at Rome? There
the practice mentioned seems to have prevailed, as we infer from
the words testimoniorum quae recitari solent (testimony which is
