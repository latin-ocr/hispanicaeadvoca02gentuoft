ticles with an official and under the orders in council of Elizabeth
they may carry them anywhere, except to the enemies of the King-
dom of England.

This reasoning is irrefutable, for although Navarrus said that
a prince could not free his subjects from the application of that law
of the Pontiff or of the Council, this conclusion would be true in the 91
case of those princes who acknowlege that they are not true sover-
eigns. We say in the case of a sovereign prince what Navarrus said
of the pontifi, that a sovereign prince can free his subjects from that
law, which would only be binding because all are bound to obey
the precept of the pontifi, as Navarrus, in following other authors,
puts it. mm This is the principle which the glossator, Innocent,
Hostiensis, Ancharanus‚ and Felynus hand down in this case concern-
ing the power of the Pontiff and the Church. But in this case the
King of England, the King now of Great Britain, will not brook being
made subject either by' the Maltese or by other peoples to the laws
of anyone else, and it concerns the public peace that no doctrine of
this sort be listened to. ¹¹1¹st was a very wise thing that, in the ar-
ticles of peace, even the King of Spain does not mention among his
friends the Roman Pontiff whose name Is not usually omitted else-
where. Tell me, would the French brook being made subject to
those laws? Would the Venetians? No, is the answer given by the
men mentioned above, who write that the aforementioned laws are
not followed. 0⁰ Others observe that these laws are not followed,
even by the people of Pisa or of Genoa. This offense is ecclesiastical,
as Ancharanus and Zabarella remark. The King of England, the
King of Great Britain, the head and arbiter of ecclesiastical affairs
in his own domain will see to it. pp Indeed, even under canon law
the Pontiff has only wished to show Princes what punishment ought
to be imposed for this offense, recognizing the fact that on the Princes
fell the duty of imposing it. This is the reply which we make con-
cerning the laws of the Emperors, which are binding on the subjects
of the Emperors, not on other people, and not on the subjects of the
King of Great Britain.

These statements unquestionably apply to all laws, whether can-
onical or civil. The laws do not even mention this situation when a
very small quantity of contraband is carried, as in the case before us,
along with a great deal of lawful merchandise. With reference to
the guiding principle of those laws which contain the law of nations 92
and hold all men to strict conformity, and with reference to our dis-
cussion in the books “On the Law of VVar,” we make this reply:
From these sources they can prove only that the Maltese and others
may obstruct this trade, not that they may punish either in person
or in property those who seem willing to act in violation of this
