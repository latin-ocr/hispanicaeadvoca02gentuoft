tion applied in practice, when it is true that the parties concerned in
the sale were in harmony concerning the article and the price, but
said, “We will make the instrument tomorrow.’' Do they seem by
using words of this sort to have wished to complete the contract
of sale in writing? The result is important, he says, because in the
meantime they would have an opportunity to change their minds‚ since
the contract cannot be thought of as finished until after the instru-
ment has been published. But he concludes that it is not a contract
in writing on account of the aforesaid reasoning of Salycetus‚ and
because otherwise the contracting parties would be inconsistent in
having finished the contract of sale by a simple agreement, and then
in having canceled it, by postponing the matter to the following day.
This is weak reasoning, and begs the question with reference to the
completion of a contract, although this case is not the same as that
of Decianus, about which we are talking here, nor is it the same as
was that of Butrigarius, or of Faber, or the other. They are not
dealing with cases where the instrument is made while the agreeing
or contracting—such are the terms employed in drawing up an in-
strument—is in the process of making, but where the instrument is
made subsequent to the contract. But Barbatia says that he carried
the day in that case of his. Furthermore, Decianus cites in addition
Ρ Fabianus, as well as Afflictis, and consequently Afflictis is inconsis-
tent, since he is cited to the opposite effect by Decius. Decianus quotes
Angelus too, who thought that the parties concerned seemed to wish
to have the contract published in a written form in the specific case
when they say that it would not otherwise hold, unless set down in
writing. This is the same kind of false reasoning, for his opponents
will say that the argument counts in their behalf, so that, if the con·
tract were in writing, it would also be conditional, pending, imper-
fect, until a written statement of it has been made. But the converse
of their argument, that, if it were not in writing, it would not be a
pending one either, would not hold.

He cites also Franciscus Aretinus, who replies to the dicta of
Castrensis and says that he observes the common usage and practice

to the effect that, although an agreement may be reached to call in a
notary, still for that reason the document would not be called a con-

tract made in writing, but only a paper by way of proof. Decianus
himself adds that in reality he today sees such a usage and practice
everywhere followed. On this point I would remark that the

doctor who testifies about the usage outside of the district where he
has lived ought not to be trusted, indeed, that it is not even clear

whether such a doctor ought ever to be trusted. clIn fact, a
number of writers hold this view, and testify that it is the common

opinion that he should not be trusted, except perchance in the case of
