CHAPTER VI

II‘’l1etlzcr It Is Lawful to Conduct an Enemy Captive throuqh
Anotlzer’s Territory

ε*ΑΗ writers agree that it is not unlawful to transport grain
through a place, from which it is still unlaw·ful to export it, so that
it may be regarded also as lawful to conduct property taken from the
enemy and to conduct the enemy captive through that territory,
from which still it might not be lawful to take them. ¹³ Then it is an
undoubted fact, says Decianus, that, if a captive be led to prison
through the graveyard of a church‚ he will not be safe on that
account, but may be taken from there. He states too that this is the
opinion of Archidiaconus, of Oldradus, and of many others, that
it is the more correct doctrine, a doctrine to be accepted, and one
observed in practice. COther authors too may be added to the au·
thorities cited by Decianus, viz.‚ Albericus‚ Caepolla, and others.

Caepolla literally says that a criminal who has been taken
in a territory where seizure is permitted may 136 conducted through
another's territory and not be set free there. dThe mere passage
through does not mean protection, says Felynus in a similar discus-
sion, where a man is forbidden to be in a church without being for-
bidden to pass through the church‚ because otherwise he would be safe
there.

Again‚ if in another's territory it is not lawful to seize wzhat
belongs to the enemy, neither should what has been seized elsewhere
be released there. If it does not suffer capture there, neither may it
become free there. And vice versa, the same doctrine would hold,
and the law is consistent in all cases.

Agaim is not traveling unrestricted‚ and traveling by sea (on
this point the issue arises in my case), is it not especially free? Be·
sides, the sea and seashore are the common property of everybody
-Ε the sea. most clearly recognized as common property, says Jason.
Now, the Spanish Ambassador opposes the action of the Dutch in
taking property captured from their Spanish enemies by this route,
through the Eritish sea and along these shores, and he asks the
magistrate here that all the property be stopped and be released.

fIs it proper for the king or for our magistrate to take from
their friends, the Dutch, a gain which is lawful, or due them, or
