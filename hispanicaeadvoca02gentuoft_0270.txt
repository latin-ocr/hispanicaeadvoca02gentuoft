241 CHAPTER XXX
Of the Completion of a Contract before the Instrument Is Finished

Decianus ³ also treats at great length another question, namely‚
whether a contract is complete or not before the instrument cover-
ing it has been made, especially when the contracting parties have
talked of making an instrument. The question arises in the case of
all those contracts which can be made without writing, for in others
which under the law require writing, it is undoubtedly the case that
no transaction has taken place, unless there is a document,

In the first mentioned contracts, then, b Decianus says that writ-
ing may be thought of as necessary only by way of proof. An illus-
tration of this is a nuncupative will, even if the testator give instruc-
tions to have a copy of it made in writing. 0 So the doctrine stands.
Besides, a thing can be proved in other ways, although there is a
dictum d that the arrangements should be set down in writing.

Furthermore, says Decianus, that is called complete which has
an efficient, formal, material, and final cause. A contract has all
these elements, even if an instrument has not been made, for it has
as an efficient cause the contracting parties themselves: it has a
material cause in the agreement out of which the contract comes, a
separate agreement made by each party. It is clear that the common
agreement, put together in a single statement, is a formal cause; the
final cause appears in the obligation, because the agreement is to the
effect that there shall be an obligation, and about these points the
situation is clear with reference to a man who in his own case thus
recognizes the aforesaid agreement by shaking hands—an outward
sign of a completed contract—and by other acts, which in that case
are supported by evidence and performed by him.

242 Likewise to that point on which the present discussion turns, to
the effect that there would be no agreement, when an agreement has
been reached that a notary should be called, and a written document
drawn up, eif the written document did not follow, Decianus re-
sponds that the law is speaking of the situation, and holds good, when
it has been arranged between the parties concerned that the contract
shall be valid only when a document has been drawn up3 or when the
contracting parties had it in mind not to enter into the contract before
the matter is set down in writing, or before an agreement has been
reached between them that it should be set down in writing. It is
