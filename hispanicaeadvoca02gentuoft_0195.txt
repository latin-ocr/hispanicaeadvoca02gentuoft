The Pleas of a Spanish Advocate, Bk. II. 167

though we hear that kings have long arms, we do not hear that mer-
chants‚ who, living in Holland, take, so they say, things offered in the
Indies, have long ones. Or if their agents are there, to whom the
property has been handed over, has a special mandate also—n for this
must be shown—been given to the agents to acquire possession?
Servitors, as Purpuratus says, cannot acquire possession without a
special mandate. 0Possession can be had by anybody, and owner-
shIp can be acquired even by those who are unaware of their acquisi-
tion, Ι admit. Ρ But still ratification is then necessary, and this ought
to take place before anything else is done, and before a change is made
in the right of possession. But here we have such a change made by
the decree of the court, by which possession has been made over to
the Spanish ambassador. ‘³ From a mandate authorizing the transfer
of property to me I do not acquire possession, but Ι acquire it from
the transfer itself‚ for it is one thing to make a transfer, another to
order a transfer. Even when Ι have ordered you to send a thing
to me, and you send it, Ι have not acquired possession, although
you may be freed from the action of the contract. Γ The navigator
would “only’‘ have the power (observe the argument against the
Dutch, who in this manner have received from the navigator) of
giving to those persons to whom the navigator was ordered to give,
but they would have no real right in consequence of that order.
Merchandise is carried under their instructions. Then is the
possession and ownership theirs? Experience says, “No‘’ Even
if the money has corne from them, still the possession or ownership
would not yet be theirs. This and other points are to be found
in Purpuratus, the great jurist—Sa title which Menochius uses in
praising him. In the same writer one reads that no acquisition
is made by an owner, unless there be an action in person against
the agent. t In the same writer is the statement that the possession
of Titius would not be proved, even if it were recorded in the ac-
counts and in other documents that the merchandise belonged to
Titius. uEven the words of the documents, “ tradidit,” etc., do not
prove the actual transfer, and therefore do not prove the real acquisi-
tion of ownership or of possession. Only liberty to take seems to be
given, and there is only an action for damages therefrom. Χ Docu-
ments do not prove either ownership or possession. y Even by virtue
of an engagement made by a notary an absent person does not ac-
quire ownership. ²Those who are absent, as these adversaries of
ours were, do not acquire ownership without giving their mandate
through another person, who says that he has bought in their behalf.
But the purchaser acquires it, if it is acquired, that is to say, if the
other necessary conditions for securing ownership are present.
