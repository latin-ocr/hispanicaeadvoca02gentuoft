The Pleas of a Spanish Advocate, Bk. I. 11

the said intention may be taken for granted, this whole matter must
be left to the decision of the judge, who ought to decide according
to the varying practice of places and peoples. Now I have heard
some men experienced in arms assert‚ that with them the practice
prevailed‚ that, if booty were retained in camp by the enemy for a
day, it is understood to have become the property of the captors.
And the practice is reasonable enough, because, as a rule, booty
which has been lost is usually recovered the same day. Furthermore
in that lapse of time those who have lost a thing usually confess that
they have lost it, so that usually after the expiration of a day the
intention to recover seems to be given up.’'

However‚ these words of Angelus do not count on Gama’s
side, because they were applied rather to another topic, to the ques-
tion whether property which has been recaptured should be returned
to the owner or not. Another reason is that the captive Spaniards
probably did not give up their intention of freeing themselves and
their hope of being set free, since they had to be taken over the
seas, with the risks therein involved, past friendly shores, before the
eyes of their countrymen. Angelus himself adds to this considera-
tion the fact that a series of days, no matter how long, does not
constitute the required interval, if those who have lost their property
pursue the plunderers. Then too, it is only a custom that Angelus
speaks of, no matter how reasonable it may be. But the law in
regular use says that the booty captured must be brought within the
fortified lines.

Ι say also that in the case before us this reasonableness is not
established by the best of arguments when it is based on the law
which states that wild beasts which have escaped from our custody
cease to be ours, for there is a great difference between the loss of
one’s property and the escape of wild beasts. In their case this
would be the easier rule to follow, and liberation and return to the
natural state are given preference. Why, does our property cease to
be ours‚ if it passes out of our custody? Angelus says that the case
is comparable with that of a thief caught in the act, when the man
has been apprehended before he has carried a thing to the place
whither he had intended to carry it. But I do not see that our
question is parallel. Of course a thief ceases to be a thief caught
in the act, after the transfer of the stolen property to its intended
place, but shall property cease to be ours after its transfer to a place
chosen by the enemy?

In no wise do these words of Angelus stand in our way, and
nothing else in this matter opposes our defense, dd and the particle
“at once ” which admits of a lapse of time here and elsewhere does
not stand in our way. The article taken becomes at once the prop-
