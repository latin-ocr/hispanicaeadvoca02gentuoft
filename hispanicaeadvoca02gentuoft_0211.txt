The Pleas of a Spanislz Advocate, Bk. II. 183

a verdict may injure a third party only when the litigant takes action
in his own name, not in the name of the third party, ii as Bartolus
puts it, and that in this case the navigator brought action in the name
of the owners, not in his own name. This point may not be urged
against me, I say, because it is a very doubtful one, and may be well
argued on both sides, kk as Alexander shows in discussing the ques-
tion through five columns and in citing besides many authors on the
one side and the other, and in bringing forward strong reasons on
the one side and the other. Although he seems to conclude with
the opinion of Bartolus‚ which I have mentioned, ,¹¹ still Bertrandus
thinks that even the opinion of Alexander to the opposite effect
inclines more to Innocent. Bertrandus himself follows Innocent, and
even Alexander makes an exception of very many cases in which the
opinion of Innocent should be followed.

”³¹¹¹ Now, there is one case, which is called the seventh by Alex-
ander, in which those in whose name legal action has been brought
have been not only informed but even present, so that the matter
which has been adjudicated surely injures them, and this point would
count against those adversaries of ours who have also been present
during the litigation. They have no hope. The judge may not listen
to them on any pretext. Furthermore‚ the case which was cited as
the first one by Alexander, and reported by us in the preceding chap-
ter, of the agent who goes beyond the limits of his mandate, serves
us as a reply to all of them. The agent is no other than the owner.
At this point there is no place for the dictum, ΠΗ that a verdict, al-
though it may at times benefit the other party, still may never injure
him. Although that dictum does apply, if there be no connecting link
and unifying principle. Here knowledge is the justification. ⁰0 Fur-
thermore, knowledge in respect to the matters which come into dis-
pute is enough. pp Manifestly knowledge is proved by probable
inferences3 it is fully proved by several presumptions which dovetail
into one another, etc., <m and in this case knowledge even of the
action which followed, dealing with the appeal of the navigator, is
enough for us, as Imola and Alexander assert, and they are talking
with reference to a third party who in our case is not even a third
party.
