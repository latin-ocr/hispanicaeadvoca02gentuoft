against Christians‚ especially in judicial proceedings. Perhaps the
merchants would not be injured either, by the invoices inclosed in
the bundles which favor the Turks, while, on the other hand, the
marks favor our countrymen. You know, of course, that they too
are from the Turks3 and besides, we should examine the handwrit-
ing of the invoices, take into account the place where they were found,
and the chance which the Turks had here. ¹There are other points
too that we should look into closely, since our merchants will pro-
duce their own marks and their own proofs in addition. Likewise
they will bring up the question of the records stolen from them,
m which would be an evidence of the weak case of our opponents. In
the meantime since the process has not only gone unwitnessed by us
but has not even been completed‚ we have nothing else whatever to
say. If the merchants should present the better case in proving their
rights, they will not only put themselves in safety but set the prisoners
free. The better proof will overcome everything.1
