CHAPTER XXIV

Of a Decree of the Judqe in a Case of Possession
A LETTER TO THE AMBASSADOR

The judge ordered that everything be sold at retail and the price
divided between the two parties to be held until a more complete
decision should be given. And apparently he has not dealt un-
favorably with us in respect to this case of possession, for our clients,
being forcibly detained, can themselves scarcely be regarded as in pos-
session. aHe too seems dispossessed who is in restraint, as our men
were3 but yet I do not say that our clients ceased to possess in the
civil sense, inasmuch as they might have had the mind and natural
hope of recovering, and this has been touched on in our reply. But
in this action to secure possession, civil possession is not certainly
taken into account; since, indeed, as soon as his V'Vorship, the judge,
has ascertained the facts in regard to the ownership, he can be
forced, apart from any other consideration, to make a pronouncement
on the question of ownership. b “ If the judge has ascertained the
facts regarding any matter, he will be forced to make his pronounce-
ment,’' says the law. ⁰ And the commentators say that when he has
ascertained the facts regarding the possession, at the same time as
those regarding the ownership, he will even be forced by the former
to make pronouncement regarding the latter also.

Now, my reply dealt with the question of ownership and re-
garding it I have good hope, although I see something even yet
about which the judge may have his doubts. Why, pray, he will
exclaim, should these goods be released, even though they cannot be
held in restraint in the territory of the King? How does that fol-
low? How does that follow for the prisoners themselves? Surely
they cannot under the King's law accuse the captor, the assailant;
d for they, being enemies, may be slain with perfect right anywhere,
not merely captured, if the sovereign of the territory should not for-
bid it. Even now let these assailants be expelled under a penalty,
as Clarus² expresses his view with regard to thieves withdrawing
from alien territory to that of Milan.

The judge will bring forward as another objection the long
interval of two months, during which the freebooters held their booty
