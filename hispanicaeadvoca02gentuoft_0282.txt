was not ordained a priest in due form who lacked about forty
days of passing beyond his twenty-fourth year, no matter how little
the one who ordered his ordination thought there was in those days;
because the candidate for ordination ought to have finished that year,
that is, to have passed beyond it and touched his twenty-fifth year,
says Navarrus. And there are other statements to this effect and
very many statements about the strict interpretation of the statutes.

However, these considerations are not decisive, and I think
that the opposite view in the proposed question is in harmony with
the law, so that that youth, for example, may be elected to the college
in accordance with the statute. Now, I arn led to adopt this view
by the consideration ffthat the doctors without exception give as
their opinion that, in the case of gifts and honors and beneficent
things, it is indeed sufficient to have touched the year; and that in
those cases time begun is regarded as time completed. This view too
panormitanus says is the common one, although he himself thinks
the law Is otherwise.

Besides, no difficulty is caused by the fact that the law ex·
pressly mentions the completion of the year; gg for it is certain that
statutes are brought under the interpretation of the common law.
¹²¹¹ This gives rise to that definition among others, in this matter of
elections, that if there is a statute to the effect that a man is to be
elected to a college by the consent of all, the statute, in accordance
with the common law, is understood to mean “ by the consent of the
majority.'’ Statutes receive this interpretation, which is called ‘⁶ pas-
sive,” from the common law. This is the general view of all with
reference to the law omnes ροριιῖἰ.1

iiThen, too, we are right in getting this result by wresting the
words of the statute from their usual meaning, in spite of the fact
that there is a statute to the effect that statutes are to be inter-
preted literally. kkNow, too, concerning this statute the view is
expressed that it has little or no effect. ¹¹ It is the casuistical inter·
pretation alone that this statute excludes; it does not exclude that
which is in accord with the common law. “¹¹¹² For this is not only an

acceptable, but also the necessary interpretation.
¹¹¹¹ Statutes must be understood according to the rules of the law,

and never in such a way that they become at variance with a case
decided according to the common law. 00 The wording of statutes
must be brought into harmony with the interpretation of the common
law. m> We must understand statutes in harmony with the art of
men of letters, and thus there are countless cases in which there is no
doubt. I note once more Baldus’s statement about electing by the
consent of all, and that this statute is to be understood, in accordance
