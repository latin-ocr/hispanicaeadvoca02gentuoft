The Pleas of a Spanislz Advocate, Bk. II. 255

with the common law, to be speaking of a majority vote, and likewise,
that according to the common law, according to the interpretation of
the common law, and according to the art of men of letters, in
beneficent cases the man who has entered upon his seventeenth year
is considered to have completed it. qq And thus the law which in
beneficent cases requires a man to be of a certain number of years is
understood to accept him also who has entered upon the last of those
years.

And a settlement of the case is to be found in specific cases, and
in specific cases also it appears to be as I have given it. A certain
man was being prevented by a will from making disposition of the
things left to him by that will, before the completion of his twentieth
year, and yet he made his disposition at the beginning of his twentieth
year. r‘That the disposition standS, is the reply of Menochius‚ be-
cause the testator's words with reference to the completion of the
year are to be understood of its beginning, when we are dealing with
beneficent cases, and we may say that a year is sufficiently complete
from the time that it is regarded as complete. Accordingly, we take
the same position and maintain that the seventeenth year is said to
be sufficiently complete from the time that it is regarded as complete.
There will be no hesitation caused by the fact that Menochius is
speaking of a will, while we are dealing with a statute. The principle
Menochius states is general, ³⁵ and these two, the law and the will,
are on a parity and afford each other arguments mutually. I do not
as yet see what reply can be made to these arguments.

There is another argument in the fact that statutes of this
kind which speak of admitting none into a college except him who has
certain qualities are not to receive a rigid, but rather a kindly interpre-
tation, and that in a doubtful case the man is to be admitted. tt This
is the reply of Ancharanus in dealing with the statute of a certain
college in which care was taken that a [student] admitted to one
study there at the beginning should not be able to change. He replies
that the student not only can change, but can change within six months
or even more, because a man is said to be still at the beginning, that
is, at the beginning of several years; and this is done by broadly inter-
preted equity, as he says. In another statute there was a provision

that one should not be received into the college unless he came from
the state or territory. ¹³¹³ Baldus replied that the man should be

receiVed who came from the territory in a relative sense and in a gen-
erous interpretation of the phrase, for these statutes are to be taken

in this liberal sense.
This statement about the territory is to be taken in a broad sense,

but such a statute as this is to be interpreted strictly in case of a
prohibition, as '0‘ others infer from Baldus and Felynus‚ and yet they,
