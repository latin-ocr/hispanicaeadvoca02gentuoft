Of an Exception Based on Nullity
TO THE SAME PERSON

Ι 113ν6 said that the decree which has been given to cover the
handing over of eight chests of sugar to the Dutchman is null and
void for various reasons, and I have said so in accordance with the
law. Β Let me say that a verdict is null and void which has a mani-
fest error either in itself or in its relation to the procedure. Now, the
decree has the error that it orders chests which do not exist to be
handed over, and a decree which covers something else than has been
asked for is null and void. It covers the handing over of such
chests as have not been asked for. b A verdict pronounced with ref-
erence to things not asked for is null and void. A verdict is null
and void which has not been rendered in due form, according to the
title De sententiis ex periculo recitandis ¹ in the Code, and this decree
has not been handed down in due form. CA verdict is null and
void which has been pronounced hastily3 in this case our witnesses
have not been accepted, the testimony on the other side has not
been furnished to us, the judge has not been informed. In this case
the judge, as in a certain case of Cephalus, though requested by
our agent at once before the giving of the decree, was willing to
wait only 3 very little time, so far was he from wishing to have
the matter discussed in 3 full inquiry, to have parties frequently
interrogated, to have other things done, and the failure to do
these things proves the haste I speak of. That verdict is null and
void which favors the Dutchman, when he does not have 3 man·
date. Let the mandate be shown, if there is one, that this Dutchman
is to take legal action against the ambassador of the King‚ or the
other necessary documents. dNullity resulting from a failure to
produce a mandate is always urged even after a verdict has been
given. Thus there are several points which would show the nullity
of this verdict. I call this decree, which partakes more of the char-
acter of a definitive verdict‚ a verdict, not an interlocutory decree‚
esince this matter is estimated from its leading characteristic. Be-
sides, this decree, which directly and chiefly defines the whole matter
of the possession and ownership of these eight chests‚ is clearly a
