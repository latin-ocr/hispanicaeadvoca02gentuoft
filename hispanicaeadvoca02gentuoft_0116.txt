the Christian law are considered heathen,’‘ says Alciatus. ὁ Besides,
these Turks are heathen for every other reason; they are alien
heathen, whom the law has in view, that is, they are not subjects
of the Empire, for some heathen are subjectS. Therefore, the civil
law, which apparently can be today called the law of nations, and
has a common relation to all Christian nationS, is to the effect that it is
82 expedient that the Turks be in want and not rendered more powerful.

Now the canon law: e ‘⁴ Such an insatiable greed has filled the
hearts of some people that those who glory in the name of Chris-
tian are furnishing the Saracens with armos, iron, and helmet straps‚
and become the equals of the heathen, or even surpass them in wrong-
doing by furnishing them with arms and necessaries for fighting the
Christians. There are people even who in their greed act as cap-
tains and pilots in the galleys and piratical ships of the Saracens.
Such people, therefore, we decree have been cut off from communion
with the Church and excommunicated; they are to be deprived of their
goods by Catholic Princes and to be made the slaves of those who
capture them.'' These and other decrees found elsewhere belong to
the same law. For instance, “we excommunicate and anathematize
those faithless and impious Christians who against Christ himself
and Christian people furnish the Saracens with arms‚” etc. There
is no doubt that this is to be taken of the Turks also. Even the Sara-
cens are Turks: f “ The Saracens handed over the headship of their
Empire to the Turks on condition that they should give up idolatry,
adopt the creed of Mohammed‚ and be initiated into the rites of the
Saracens. This request was readily granted by a people who were
heathen and very eager for the honor.'’ Why shall I speak of other
constitutions of pontiffs who followed? They deal with Turks and
with heretics. Thus canon law expresses itself in lines of reasoning
which are truly catholic, if it behooves no Christian to aid the ene-
mies of Christ. Now, to carry these implements of war to the Turks
would be tantamount to arming them against the common Christian
fatherland‚ against all our Christian brothers, against Christ himself,
the head of us all.

Furthermore, in like manner the law of nations would seem to
be against the English, g as Ι have myself apparently proved by main-
taining at length in my books “ On the Law of VVar,” that it was not
lawful for the Hanseatic cities to furnish to the Spaniards supplies and
that which is usually of service in war, when the Spaniards were ene-

83 mies of the English. In that connection Ι reach this conclusion: “ The
arguments which I made in behalf of the English, Ι make now both
against the English and against the others who at the present time
during the war between the Emperor and the Turk would take war-
like supplies to the Turk. Do not unto others what ye would not
