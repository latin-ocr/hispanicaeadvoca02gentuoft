inconsistent, the view which he held in the Consilia ought to be fol-
lowed. But in this case in the Consilia Castrensis is quoted in sup-
port of the former view, and everybody recognizes the fact that it
is the real view of Castrensis.

Decianus quotes Gratus in support of his opinion that an agree-
ment to ask a notary for an instrument would not give an opportunity
for a change of mind, if the contract were otherwise perfected, and
this view the doctors commonly hold. However, he does not reach
the conclusion in this connection that for these reasons the contract is
not conditional, even if there is not an opportunity for a change of
mind. Furthermore, Gratus is talking of a completed contract, and
to bring this point into our discussion would be doing nothing else
than begging the question. Consequently, although Decianus adds
that it is clear that the opinion which he himself defends is the
common one, to me it is not clear. The opposite view is given by
Oldradus, Johannes Andreae, Johannes de Anania, Fulgosius, Imola,
Jason, Socinus, as well as by Castrensis, Decius, and Afflictis and is
presented in res iudicatae, in which different conclusions are set
down.

Decianus says the following reasoning is incontrovertible,
namely, that we take it for granted that the parties concerned have
adapted their action to the provisions of the law. But the law calls

for instruments only by way of proof. In his case completeness is »

proved most effectively‚ as he says, by reason of the repetition, be-
cause it had been said, “ Done, done.’' To my mind, this reasoning
is most ineffective‚ in the first place, because the repetition occurred
at the same moment, and, therefore, would not be so binding as is
taken for granted by t Decianus and by the others everywhere in their
writings; in the second place, because these words refer to what has
been done, and, therefore, the reasoning should set forth all the
characteristics of the act.

Now, let us see how he replies to the points which are urged
in support of the opinion of Castrensis, and we shall understand
how we are to reply to the other incontrovertible reason. He says
that two points are put forward in support of the view of Castrensis:
first, the aforementioned law contractus,² at the beginning, in the line
quas tamen in scriptis fieri placuit, combined with the line immediately
following it. From these the following matters seem to be put on a
parity, the agreement to contract in writing and the agreement to
draw up an instrument. Decianus replies that a parallel is set up,
when the condition has been expressly made that the contract holds if
made in writing, or if an instrument to cover it be made; that it is
otherwise, when, after making a contract unconditionally, they have
