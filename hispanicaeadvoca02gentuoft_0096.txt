journey to Belgium would be easy. ³³ The redress, τοο, which is the
more feared, should be adopted. Now, the only fear the Dutch have,
is that the Spaniards may be sent to Belgium. bb The redress ought
to fit the offense. Now, the Dutchman has offended in hindering the
Spaniards here. Therefore, he should be punished by helping them
away from here. ceIf he cannot be punished in a way to fit the
crime, let him be punished in the opposite way. Justice would have
been done without giving ground for righteous indignation‚ if a man
suffers what he does not wish when he does that which he ought not
to do.

But I hear the parallel case cited of the King of France, who
sent Spaniards back to Spain not so long ago; he did not send them
to Ireland, whither they were sailing at the time, as enemies of the
English. I am not so sure that this is a parallel case. Indeed, if the
English committed no crime against the territory of France, then it
would not be a parallel case, nor one of the same nature in any respect
with the present situation of the Dutch. Look at the countrieS‚ too.
It just suited the Spaniards in going to Ireland to be sent back from
France to Spain, for that would be the direct route from Spain to
Ireland.

But for those who are on their way to Belgium, and are in sight
of Belgium, and can reach the friendly shores of BelgiUm in four
hours with a favorable wind, even against the will of the Dutch,
to be sent back from here to Spain, what else is that than to pile
injury upon injury in the case of people whom it would be more fair
to help?

This is what Ι think, if only the King approves. With him it
is left to decide, as I think, what punishment he would exact from
those who have violated his territory and how satisfaction should be
given to the injured Spaniards, dd whom the Dutch could not law-

fully harm anywhere in the territory of another against the will of
the ruler of the territory.
