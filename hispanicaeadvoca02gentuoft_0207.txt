On tlte Same Arqument concerninq a res judicata between Certain
People Which Injzcres Others

Alexander ³ mentions many conditions which must be met that
a verdict pronounced between certain people may injure others. He
affirms that the citation of the third party at least by a general

proclamation is required, and that Angelus holds this view. ¹³ Notice

also that Bologninus supports this dictum of Angelus vigorously
against Imola. who alone has seemed to oppose it, although he ought
to yield, in Bologninus' opinion, to the authority of his teacher An-
gelus, for the others who do not consider citation necessary, we may
understand, are thinking of a special citation, so that their views
would harmonize with the views of those who consider citation neces-
sary. In like manner also we may understand that the glossator on
the l. de unoquoque, ff„ De re judicata,² is thinking of a special cita-
tion, for this law is talking of a special citation, just as the glossator
is in the limitation which he applies in discussing 1. saepe.²

The objection may not be urged that l. saepe speaks in gen-
eral only of knowledge, because, when anything is required, all that
also which leads up to it and is required by the verdict under l. saepe
ought to be included. Now, knowledge calls for notification, and noti-
fication in this case comes either from a public edict or from a procla·
mation. He says further that it is wicked and cruel that a verdict
should hold against one who has not been cited, for perhaps the
defendant would have brought forward reasons which would have led
the judge to give his vei-dict in another way. This is what Bologninus
says. ⁶ But Imola does not stand alone in holding an opinion against
Angelus on this question: Alexander holds the same view. Bologninus
has done wrong in concealing the name of Alexander, who was his
teacher, for he must have known that Alexander took the side of
Imola, inasmuch as he tries to overthrow the fundamental arguments
of Alexander. But still he cannot do it, for the l. saepe calls for
knowledge, and makes no distinction as to the source from which it
comes. There would be nothing wicked in the present case, in conse-
quence of which our opponents may complain of their treatment, since
they have known about the suit, and have not opened their mouths,
