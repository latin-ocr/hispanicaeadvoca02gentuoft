out distinction of punishing men caught on the way.'' Now, this
usage will have no bearing on our case, for usages have to do with a
fact and so they do not undergo extension either in the way of place,
or of person, or of situation. Therefore, the usage must be estab-
lished for that very kind of case which comes under discussion.
Every one of these points is already known.

I offer now a third argument, based on Suarezius, whom I have

· just mentioned, to the effect that the English ought to be exonerated

for the very reason that this powder and the other material of this
sort was being carried for the ship's use. So Suarezius in the case
involving the Genoese, which he was arguing, says that the law
would not hold those who were carrying for a ship's use articles
which otherwise they would have been forbidden to carry. ὃὸ Al-
though the exportation of grain may be forbidden, still the prohibition
is not applied to that which a man carries for his own use. This
likewise Is the common opini0n under the law, whatever Clarus
whom Ι have mentioned may add to the effect that the opposite prac-
tice is followed among his countrymen. To this observance we have
just now replied, so far as our case is concerned.

But suppose there should seem to have been a somewhat larger
quantity of powder and of similar things than could apparently be
intended for the ship’s use. Why, I say that the battles in which a
ship may be engaged do not admit of so careful a calculation as
you suppose. For the use which they had to sear they provided
generously and wisely, so that they might have an excess rather than
a deficiency. Now, let no one raise the objection that the law does
not allow a soupgon of anything to be carried to the barbarians, not
even a whetstone, for that did not happen in this case of ours in
which supplies were taken for the use of the ship. Further, that
matter of the soupgon does not apply in the case of these articles
about which our questions turns. bb In that connection the purpose is
to prevent the heathen from being led by the grain and fruits which
they may have tasted to turn their arms against us. Now, the purpose
in this case is to prevent the heathen from being helped against us
in carrying on war. But no help can come from such a scanty supply,
for, ⁰⁰ when the law mentioned a “ whetstone‚’' without doubt in ac-
cordance with a common legal practice it wished to cover a number
of things of the same sort by the particular term. Remember, too,
that the Turks today are not the same people they were three hun-
dred years ago, when those canon laws were published, a people un-
acquainted with all these articles and lacking thern. At that time
that matter of the soupcon would be applicable, even in the case of
those articles which, carried to them in ever so tiny a quantity, could
have taught them of how much value property was and how it was
