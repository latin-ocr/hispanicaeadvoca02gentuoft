met to draw up an instrument. Just as Bartolus and the whole body
of doctors understand the text in that connection, and in a special case
Barbatius responds in this way. But Decianus by the above-mentioned
arguments, by which he says that he has established this attitude on
the part of the entire body, in my opinion, has not established it.

But he confirms this response most effectively, as he says; for
there is the statement, “which still it has been decided to have set
down in writing,‘' and the word “sti11,” without a connective, stands
in opposition in law and in fact to what precedes. However, in
what precedes reference is made to contracts‚ therefore to completed
contracts‚ and therefore the words, “which still it has been decided
to have set down in writing,’' we shall understand do not apply
to contracts entered into unconditionally, but only apply to those
which the contracting parties have wished to have set down in writ-
ing. Therefore, if the adversative particle were not added, the
contract entered into unconditionally, even if the statement had been
made that it should be reduced to writing, would have been complete.
Ι explain it more intelligibly as follows, that those words, “the con-
tracts to be made in writing,'’ clearly indicate nothing about finishing
an instrument covering a contract, but apply to the actual entering
into a contract in writing. The same thing is true of the words, “it
has been agreed that these are to be entered in the instrument.’'
These words likewise point to the formal procedure itself in trans-
acting a piece of business, but they do not refer to a completed trans-
action. 'WelL so much for the law.

He quotes also the reasoning of Paulus Castrensis, that when
the parties concerned have come together to make an instrument,
it does not appear that they wished at that time to finish the contract.
Consequently, the notary puts in the day on which he is summoned,
but not the day when the contract was previously published. There-
fore the day would not be that on which the contract was completed.
To this reasoning Decius replies in various ways. Decianus approves
his fourth response, that it does not follow from this fact that the
contract was imperfect before, for the summoning of the notary is a
repetition, as it were.

Decianus adds that the perfecting of a contract is regarded
in a three-fold way: first, when it is not lawful to depart from it be-
cause of a change of mind: secondly, when the question of the risk
to the thing made the subject of the contract arises, thirdly, when the
question of the implement covering the contract comes up. uNow,
the first process in perfecting a contract, which is based on the agree-
ment only, takes place at once when an agreement has been reached,
even if the contract be subject to a condition, for not even in that
situation is a change of mind allowable. In the second process one
