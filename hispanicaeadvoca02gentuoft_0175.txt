CHAPTER V
Of lVitnesses lVlzo Are Criminals

Greek expounders think that ὃ in criminal actions witnesses who
are criminals are accepted: ἐπὶμαρτύρων ἐπὶ βίαςῒ μαρτυρούντων ἢ 143
ὕβρεως καὶ τῶν ἄλλων περιστατικών, ὠς ἐπὶ πᾶν ου’ ᾅητεῑται ό τρό-
πος τῶν μαρτύρων καὶ ὁ βίος, ὡς ὁ μάγῑστρος ἔλεγεν, “ in the case of
witnesses who testify concerning assault or outrage, or on matters of
that sort, generally the character of the witnesses and their life are
not inquired into, as the Master was wont to say.’' The reason they
have in mind is that it would not be easy in this case, as it is in the
case of agreements, to bring in as witnesses men of an approved
manner of life. ¹³ But there is no doubt, they think, that in criminal
actions, which form an exception, witnesses of this sort are accepted.
⁰ Now, robbery is one of the exceptions and, of course, piracy, which
is the worst kind of robbery.

‘¹ They are accepted in these cases which are difficult to prove,
e and, forsooth, they are accepted so unreservedly that they are put
beyond the reach of all exceptions even. fNow, those enterprises
which are carried on secretly, as piratical undertakings of this sort
are, are difficult to prove. Of this character are cases of deceit and
pretense, and of these we are now treating, Clearly in these two
classes of cases, criminals who otherwise are in general refused as
witnesses furnish proof, as Jason says. He also names these cases
and others which are difficult to prove. XVhen I speak of him and
of the others let no one urge against me the dictum of Butrius‚ that
this is the situation when there can be no other witnesses either to
the act or the disposition, g although this dictum would be disproved
by reason, by usage, and by the teachings of Clarus. So also an-
other obstacle is removed in this case, hbased on the assertion that
one must prove that a matter is difficult to prove, for it has beon
shown that piratical conspiracies and pretenses are difficult to prove.

¹Furthermore, criminals are accepted in the case of those ac-
tions which are not done mainly in hatred of the injured party, as
homicide is, but which are for the advantage of the offender, as
theft is. This is the commonly accepted opinion, and is commonly
followed. This view is clearly recognized in all sorts of robberies,
kwhich are certainly committed to profit the robbers.

Criminals are even accepted in dealing with those acts which 144
