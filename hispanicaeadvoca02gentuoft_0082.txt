CHAPTER XII

Of Property Captured by Pirates and Afterwards Bouqht by Friends
in the Enemy’s Country

This question appears to be clearly settled by the law, as the
following passage shows: ²² “ Robbers had stolen a slave from you.
Afterwards that slave had come into the hands of the Germans. Then
when the Germans had been conquered in war, the slave had been sold.
Labeo, Ofilius, and Trebatius assert that the buyer cannot acquire
ownership of the slave by usucaption, because in reality the slave
was stolen3 and that his once belonging to the enemy, or returning
by postliminium does not affect this rule.'' The law says “ robbers.”
These are our pirates. It says “a slave.’' We speak in the same
way of other things, bbecause slaves are things. It says “Ger-
mans,⁷‘ Cthat is, an enemy, just as the law afterwards explains, and
a glossator, too. And therefore the Berbers in this case of ours
are enemies of the Spaniards in quite the same way. The law says,
“ when the Germans had been conquered in war.'' Now the Berbers,
I admit, have not been conquered, nor has the property of the Span-
iards been recovered from them through victory. Cash has bought
it back from the pirates in the Berbers' country, in part, it is as-
serted, from the Berbers themselves, to whom the pirates had sold
it or handed it over to be sold. But in each case, a sale takes place,
both in ours and in that of the law quoted. The law says, “had
been sold‚'' having been brought back through victory, but in our case
through the trade which our English merchants carry on in Barbary.
The law says: “They assert that the buyer cannot acquire ownership
of the slave by usucaption.'' And therefore he would not become the
buyer‘s‚ “because in reality the slave was stolen,'' ‘¹ “ and when a thing
is stolen, in that case the right of ownership shall be perpetual,’‘ and
that. too, against a hona fide possessor. This is the principle to be
noted, because it applies clearly to our case also. ‘⁴ The fact that he
once belonged to the enemy or returned by postliminium does not
afrect this rule,'' e for he had been merely de facto the enemy's, and
they had not been made his owners. This is the way Socinus, the
nephew, argues on this law, and I say that the alleged owners could not
remove the taint of theft by bringing the enemy into their plea; f just
as a field reverts to its former owner, from whom it has been taken by
a river, and to whom it has thus ceased to belong, though not in strict

reason. Moreover, return by postliminium would not be sufficient
