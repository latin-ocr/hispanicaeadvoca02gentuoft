or such things as are here in controversy, namely, Indian silk and
similar things, is called impossible. Let the Venetian show that the
Tunisian governor bought these disputed wares of pirates, and that
pirates carried off these same things from the Venetians. ἦ If it is
at all possible that these might be other wares, surely the identity would
not be proved, since proofs should lead to a necessary conclusion.
Then there is another difference here between this case and that
which I posited where the goods were purchased in Barbary. There
the purchase was made directly from the pirates of that which had
certainly been taken from the Spaniards. There the identity was
demonstrated and admitted. There—and this is the point—the
privilege which the fiscus had of selling was urged in objection to us;
111 but here we the rather urge the laws of the place as an objection.

What if I mention as a fifth argument that these goods had
been lost by the Venetiam, so far as both ownership and possession
are concerned? kk This, to be sure, is the view of Jason, that when a
thing has been lost, we do not say with a strict regard for the law
that either ownership or‘ possession is retained; and that such is the
case when on account of the power of robbers as well as of the enemy
the thing in question cannot be kept and there would be no hope of
recovering it. ¹¹ Resides, there is nothing here in the statement that
ownership is retained in intent, that civil possession is thus retained;
for while such an intent should not exist here where the thing is
hopelessly lost, above all neither could it accomplish anything even
if it were to exist. Property so held would be understood to be as
⁷ good as lost. “¹¹¹¹ Those things are understood to be as good as lost
which are being carried by men going to war with the expectation
that these same things will become the property of the enemy when
they conquer and capture the men. The hope of recovery is active here.
WVhere the robbers do not belong to a foreign nation that hope can
exist3 it cannot exist where they do. The laws which have respect
to the state could not apply to foreign peoples. Then, too, Ι here
seize upon the assertion of the Venetians that the seller in question
was a robber and that Tunis is a den of robbers, since they are like-
wise infidels, and therefore robbers of a foreign nation, in whatever
way you may look at it. ¹¹¹¹ Further, while they are infidels they are
likewise enemies and, therefore, what has been captured by them has
thereby become their property, and further, so true is this that the
citizen who buys the property back makes it his own3 and further, that
any one of the original owners who may chance to have bought it,
holds it now by a different right. And there is no difficulty raised
by the fact that the Turk has a treaty with Ven1ce and is a friend, as
the Venetians likewise assert; for it is certain that in spite of their
friendly relations this treaty and this friendship do not embrace
