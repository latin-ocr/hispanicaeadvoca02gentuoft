The Pleas of a Spanish Advocate, Bk. I. 61

the words seem to give another meaning. We shall understand Baldus
and the others in such a way that they may not be inconsistent, ⁶2³ as
we commonly do in such a case in opposition to the mere sound of the
words.

ffBesides‚ the doctrine which holds in a feudal matter is not
extended into another field, especially where the ruling may be differ—
ent, as it is here. Consequently, this argument takes this form both
when the question of confiscation is raised and when there would
not be a delict connected with property.

What are the points on the other side? Is it not evident here
that the King of Spain has confiscated this property? Is not this
the property of subjects, with reference to which the earlier opinion
of Baldus was set down? But the Spanish law brought about the
confiscation, the Spanish law which is the same as the King. But
the Ambassador asks for the confiscation, and he is the King here
to all intents and purposes. But it is also clear that this property was
bought in a Spanish ² land of Spanish subjects. gg Therefore‚ the pur-
pose of the Ambassador has been well founded in saying that the
goods belong to the territory where they were situated‚ hh and that
the increase of anything of ours, whether of land or of animaIS‚ is
itself ours, even if we gave no thought at all to the seed. ἦ Now,
ownership has not been transferred to the purchasers, because the law
forbids commercial transactions. This opinion is held by everybody.
kkEven the seller could make good his claim, and the purchaser in
this case loses the purchase money, as in more than one passage the
ancient commentator, Andreas de Barulo, has set forth in his com-
mentary on the books of the Code.

It does not count for the Dutch enemy, does it, that they are
within their rights in taking from the Spanish and in making the
stolen property their own? We claim that they have not acquired
ownership until the captured property has been taken within the
fortified lines. This is proved by the clear statements of the laWS,
by the harmonious views of the Commentators, by the settlement of
cases on the point at issue. Resides, from these judgments which
count against the Dutch there followsss also a general argument,
peculiarly applleable here, that if property which has been almost
acquired by the Dutch is held for the Spanish in England, and if this
property about which the cas-e before us centers belongs to the Span- 59
iards, because it has been confiscated by their King and not yet made
the property of the Dutch, assuredly, it will be kept for the Spaniard
here in England. 1¹ All of it has been confiscated and forfeited be-
cause the declaration of ownership has not been made, or, at least,
was made falsely and amounts to nothing. Let the facts be set
