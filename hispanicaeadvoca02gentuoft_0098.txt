CHAPTER XV

Of the Enqlislz IVlzo tlzrouqh the Assistance of the Treasury of the
Kinq of Barbary Have Bouqht Property Taken
from tlte Spaniards hy Pirates.

ὃ The opinion is correct which I gave in commenting on the con-
stitution of Zeno, that it is speaking of the fiscus of one's own Prince,
that is, the Prince of the man whose property is at stake, for all who
give an explanation of this law take it in this way, that the Prince may
take from me the ownership of my property. Now, surely this is
not true of a foreign prince. The laws are speaking of the Prince
and they certainly do so only with regard to his subjects. ¹³ Further-
more, when the doctors say that the treasury spoken of is present
everywhere, they are likewise speaking of the treasury of one's own
Prince, for the treasury of another Prince would have no existence
here. Consequently, in realms distinct from one another that law
would not apply.

Now, as to the fact that the law gives redress against the treas-
ury, the Spaniards have no redress, at least against the fiscus of the
King of Barbary.

Besides, this law does not apply where there is bad faith on
the part of the buyer, as Baldus quite correctly observes on that
point in a supplementary note—Fulgosius holds the same view—
whatever Baldus may write on the other side in his first two treatises.
⁰ Others speak also of the good faith which the buyer ought to show,
and they mention other qualities too which must be assumed in order
that this constitution may stand: that the Prince should have come
into possession and in good faith, das, again, others too remark;
that the buyers should be of good faith on their part. But the Eng-
lish have bought some of these goods directly from the pirates and
they knew that they were buying from pirates. θ Still the fact would
have been enough, that they ought to have known it. They knew too
that what they bought there through the intervention of the fiscus
was booty left by the pirates, for they saw these very pirates there,
and knew that all of the property must have come from the pirates,
and they recognized the same marks on all the chests. Let the judge
observe the bad saith of these merchants, who, when summoned here
to court, took pains to have these marks, which indicated the owners,
rubbed out and effaced, and were caught in the act. f The man who
