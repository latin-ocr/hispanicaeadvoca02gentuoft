said points. In general he has nothing on which to base this under·
standing of the laws or his interpretation. ’

We took the opposite view in the discussion, and we urged the
well recognized point that where the law makes no distinction we too
ought not to make one, and since the law does not speak of a friend
attached to ourselxes only or make that distinction, then we ought
not to speak of one attached to ourselves only. The law speaks of
a friend: it speaks of our friend,h and our friend is different from
a friend attached to ourselves only. Consequently, the word “ our ’'
will be applied not to a friend attached to ourselves only, but it will
be understood as used of a friend common to both parties. iAnd
in point of fact many people teach that “ our '⁹ actually applies not
to what is peculiar to ourselves but to what we share with others.
kAnd undoubtedly this is true in the case of individuals. There-
fore a man is called my freedman although another person and I
have rights in common over him. But a friend and an ally has also
without doubt the character of an individual, just as a freedman has.
Furthermore, in the preceding discussion, in cases where beneficent
action is involved, “ our ’³ (noster) is taken in the sense of “ common '’
(communis). Now postliminium is beneficent in its operation. Its
beneficent outcome is freedom. And to the same purport elsewhere
¹ there are many generally accepted dicta which support us in hold-
ing that a common friend is not excluded from consideration by the
laws which grant us postliminium when we reach our friends.

It is also true that, if we understand these laws as being solely
applicable to a friend attached to ourselves only, they would apply
to a case not open to doubt, or, at any rate, to a case less open to doubt.
¹ However, since a law ought to deal with a doubtful matter, it ought
also to be understood in a more doubtful case. But who would be in
doubt whether postliminium exists in the domain of a friend and ally
attached to ourselves only, that is to say, even (as Gama himself
puts it) in the domain of one who is an enemy to the other side? But
(jama‘s interpretation is opposed to the fundamental notion of the
law Ἤ which establishes postliminium for the point where we are safe3
but that we are safe with the ally or with the friend of both parties
no one who has eyes will deny.

Ι What Ι have said elsewhere of the sovereign power of the
mighty Roman people does not oppose our argument, ¹³ because their
laws rather concern all other peoples who had no share in that sov-
ereign power and who did not have the same method of binding their
allies to them. Even the fact which I have mentioned with reference
to the captives and slaves in Greece does not militate against this
view. One would be bound to show that they came to friends—in
time of war too, because the Romans deny the existence of post-
