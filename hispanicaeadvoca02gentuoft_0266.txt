so many acres.'⁷ The number is not to specify the limit fixed.
In the same connection Decius says that if a number, which is not
put in one chapter, is put in several other chapters one accepts the
evidence furnished by the majority, and one part of the contract is
interpreted in accordance with another. 2The same doctrines also
occur in Consilium 179, that the common rule is that a sale should
be conditional on measurement, and should not be called complete
before measurement has taken place, and that the conclusion is clear,
when the contracting parties begin to explain the purpose which they
had in mind by indicating a number or a measure. Decius discusses
in that connection whether a sale is complete, and whether possession
and ownership have changed hands by a transfer of the property when
measurement has not yet taken place. However, he says all these
points are taken into consideration, i and that Angelus and Castrensis,
as well as Corneus, make this assertion, and one ought not to depart
from them, although the law can be criticised. Decius understands
“to the other person.'’ However, kOdofredus interprets the word
‘⁶ transfer '' (tradantur) in the sense of “measure ‘’ (mensu-
rentur), and he does so on account of the preceding words
and the subject-matter. He says that the wine in the case men-
tioned was sold in the fullest sense of the term, that consequently we
cannot understand that it was handed over without being measured.
Therefore, in that case the handing over would take the place of the
measuring, and, when this was done, the wine, which was promised at
the beginning, would seem to have been given. lLikewise, he re-
marks that if a transfer without measurement were considered, meas-
urement would follow, and that, before the transfer of the property
is made, the risk is the seller’s, even after measurement is made,
which is incorrect. mLikewise, he says that the first case is when
the sale is a sale of wine in kind according to measurement3 the sec-
ond case, when it is a sale according to bulk, without measurement,
and, therefore, that the opposition may be well put, it will be said
that the transfer will be received through measurement. These views
Odofredus holds, and in opposition to them Decius says that in a
case of doubt one ought not to depart from the words of the docu-
ment. Likewise, he holds that a certain part can be alienated or pos·
sessed as undivided by reason of the quantity or by reason of the
place. When there is every kind of uncertainty in respect to both
place and quantity, then the dictum of Bartolus may be true: it is
otherwise if there is uncertainty only with respect to one of the two.
Bartolus says that centum tabulae is very uncertain on the score of
quantity. But he is led to accept the opinion of Odofredus, that a
clause of the agreement in this case would not seem to have trans-
