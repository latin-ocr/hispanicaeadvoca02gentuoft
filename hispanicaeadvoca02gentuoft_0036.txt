l‘lorace puts it. ‘⁶ You were carried on a wooden horse over the
clxirk—blue strctches,'' as Plautus writes. ¹¹A place Withln the con-
tines and presumably safe constitutes fortified lines, as Salycetus,
Castrensis. and Angelus remark. iStill I should say that fortified
lines would include the fleet of the Greeks standlng off Troy, οι·
even a camp pitched within the confines of an enemy, or the fleet of
:in enemy which was cruising about. But our situation was this, that
a Dutch'vessel had captured a Spanish ship, was taking her capture
to llolland. and had already convoyed her over the sea for two
months. as I have said.

Let us see if there are any fundamental points in Gama’s
reasoning to prove that it is not necessary for captured property to
be brought within fortified lines. What the enemy has taken be-
comes his at once and without delay, he sayS, and Angelus, Socinus
and Ripa so hold. k “ At once ’‘ means forthwith‚ thereupon, without
delav. as Aretinus in this connection explains this particle, and as I
add'to what Gama says. However, in the passage cited by him,
Angelus and Socinus in my books have not a word on the point
whether it is necessary that property be brought within the fortified
lines. ¹Angelus elsewhere remarks, “1 say then that captured booty
has become the property of an enemy when and if it has been
brought within the fortified lines of the enemy taking it. Further-
more, by fortified lines I mean places which are safe and capable of
defense because they are inclosed by walls and other means of pro-
tection or encompassed by structures lying near one another. In
that case the booty has become the property of an enemy because it
has been conducted to its destination and is safe. Before it is within
the fortitied lines described above, or at some other safe point,
in the territory of friends or allies, I do not deny that the booty
has passed under the control of the captors, granted that it has come
into the territory of the captors. Still, in view of the vicissitudes
of war it may be recovered, and those who have it must naturally
remain in doubt on this point, and the sear which I have mentioned
establishes the point which Ι make.’' This is what Angelus says.

But Ripa says: “Goods captured in war belong to the
captors at once. But one asks how the words ‘at once' in
this connection should be taken. It seems necessary to understand
them as meaning within three days. or after he from whom the goods
have been taken turns to other matters, and consequently after he
censes to possess the property, thinking that he cannot recover it.
But the glossator, Salycetus, and Angelus understand ‘at once'
to mean 'atter the captured property has been brought back within
the forti-hed lines.'‘ ln that very connection Ripa adds that
Angelus tollows this principle elsewhere also and that he cites a laW,
