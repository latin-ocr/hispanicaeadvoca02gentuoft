CHAPTER II

That Property Does Not Belonq to the Enemy tho Takes It Until
It Has Been Brouqlzt within His Fortified Lines

Therefore I have boldly maintained another point, and I have
argued effectively against Antonius Gama in holding that property
taken by the enemy is not acquired by him until it has been taken
clear through to a point within his fortified lines. This is true, how-
ever long the property may be in his possession. It is true of this
property, held, though it was, for more than two months at sea.
ὃ In fact the law stipulates that it be captured and taken clear through
to a point within the enemy’s confines. “They have captured and
taken it clear through to a point within their confines‚” it says. Here
the expression “ to take clear through ’³ (perduco) deserves notice.
This expression the law has used several times. It indicates the com-
pletion of a task‚ b for per indicates totality. ⁰ For this idea the law
uses very frequently also the expression “to come clear through '³ d
and it ought to be taken to imply successful accomplishment. If two
months do not suffice for the captor, a thousand would not. Prop-
erty must be captured and brought within the captor‘s confines. Time
counts for nothing. The law does not take it into account. Indeed
time counts for nothing in this case, where booty is always of doubt-
ful ownership so long as it has not been taken within the captor’s
fortified lines. The proverb goes “there's many a slip 'twixt the
cup and the lip‚'’ and the nature and lot of war abundantly prove the
truth of it, Β as I have maintained at length elsewhere.

In the case which Ι took up for the Spaniards, who were taken
prisoners by the Dutch, there was a stretch of the sea to be crossed;
there were the shores of the enemy to be skirted, and the people of
these regions too were on the watch to prevent the taking of booty
and were prepared to checkmate it. Disaster coming from the
weather and the sea were also to be feared. Therefore, the law
properly stipulates that property be brought within the fortified
lines. But it is clear that a ship to which captured goods had been
brought does not constitute a fortified lIne, ffor a ship is classed
as a movable thing. A fortified line, however, is something sta-
tionary. ἓΑ ship does not rest: it moves, and is comparable to a
vehicle, or rather to a horse—“ He rode over the Sicilian waves‚'' as
