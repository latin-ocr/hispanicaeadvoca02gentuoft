CHAPTER XIII

To What Extant α res judicata Αἶα] Injure a leird Palmy, and
concerninq His Appeal and tlte Impropriety of
Delayinq the Execution

A res iudicata prejudices a third party also. ΞιΑ res iudicata
creates a right: it is accepted as the truth3 no one is listened to who
speaks against it, etc. It even injures a third party when carried to
the point of being half-proved, in such wise in fact that the rest of
the case may be finished by taking an oath. ¹³ This is the teaching of
Bartolus, which is followed by Butrius‚ Ancharanus, Panormitanus,
Romanus, Alexander, Socinus, Decius, Tiraquellus‚ and Menochius‚
who cites them all and says that the view ought not to be called
in question. ⁰ To these writers I add Alciatus, Decianus, Purpuratus‚
Ruinus, the Rota of Genoa and GozadInus, who testifies about all
of them as holding this opinion in his note to l. 2, Code, De edicto}
The people who talk of the opposite opinion as the common one
are absurd. Even those who differ from Bartolus are on his side,
when there is any connection between the cases or common element in
them, as there is in ours. This opinion ought to be held, as at least
midway between the two views, and as reconciling other opinions.
But if the third party is injured by the verdict, and does not appeal
from it, then it is transformed into a judgment against him.

dSometimes the third party cannot appeal; he cannot, if the
man against whom the verdict has been pronounced could not.
ewhen he can, he is surely under obligation to appeal, that is, if he
has neither protested during the trial when the other was concerned,
to prevent it harming him, nor removed from the suit the litigant
whom he could have removed. f He ought to have appealed in that
manner and time in which he might have appealed, had he been de-
feated himself, within ten days from the time when he knew that the
verdict had been pronounced, g for he who does not appeal at the ap-
propriate time seems to agree to a verdict and to give up the right
to appeal. Likewise negligence at least is shown on the part of one
who could use suitable remedies and has not used them. Further-
more, there is no way of going back to what has been renounced.
hWhat shall I say to the fact that without an appeal a new trial is
started by a third party, and that therefore execution ought not to
