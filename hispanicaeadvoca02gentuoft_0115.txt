CHAPTER XX

Of an Enqlish Slzip Sailinq to Turkey with a Quantity of Powder
and Other Affercharzdise

If this question were raised in our country, as the advocate here
in ordinary of the Spaniards, I should either argue for the Spaniards
or say nothing for the sake of truth. But the question at issue is be-
ing examined in Spain, where it is surely not unbecoming on my part to
publish something written by me in defense of my English friends,
whether this count against the Maltese or against the Sardinians,
when even the Spanish ambassador here, Pedro de Zufiiga, a man
noble, eminent and distinguished for all the other virtues, sent to Spain
a commendatory letter in behalf of these same Englishmen.

The facts are that an English ship, laden with a little powder, a
small amount of similar equipment, and much other merchandise, when
on the way to Constantinople was captured by the Sardinians and
Maltese. The English are now complaining of the wrong, and they
ask me if they are justified in their complaints. I, because of my
slender ability, though after considering all the points carefully,
at first decided that all the laws, civil, canonical, the law of nations,
and the law governing contracts apparently cried out against the
English.

These are the civil laws: ³ “ Let no one have the power to trans-
port wine, oil, or any liquid to heathendom even to give them a taste‚
to say nothing of satisfying the demands of trade.'' ‘⁶ Let no one dare
to sell to alien heathen [. . .] coats of mail, shields, bows, arrows,
broad-swords, swords, or arms of any other sort whatsoever. Let abso-
lutely no weapons be retailed to them by anyone, and no iron at all,
whether already made up or not, for it would be harmful to the
Roman Empire, and would approach treason to furnish the heathen,
who ought to be without equipment‚ with weapons to make them
stronger. But if anyone shall have sold any kind of arms anywhere
to alien heathen of any nation whatsoever in violation of the inter-
dicts of our holy religion, we decree that all his goods be straight-
way confiscated, and that he too suffer capital punishment.'' bTo
this effect are the other civil laws and their expounders. They forbid
the doing of that, which in the present case is said to have been done
by the English, for no Christian will deny that the Turks are
heathen. 0 “ Today by serious-minded men people who are not of
