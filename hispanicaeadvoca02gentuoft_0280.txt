have appealed from that part of the first verdict which had to
do with releasing the deposit, although from the other part, in which
the ambassador showed that he had possession, they could not have
appealed, efor a deposit is not always canceled by a bond, and
in this case reasons could be given why it should not be canceled.
f Our adversaries did not see that one may take an appeal against the
acceptance of bondsmen, or they did not know the decision in specific
cases. But if the point had been made against us, then we should have
proved gthe suitability of the bondmen, and that matter the judge
undoubtedly would have decided in the light of general principles.

Kinq and Master:

In piratical cases there is no appeal through an edict of your
Majesty, unless the appellant deposits the whole sum to the payment
of which he has been condemned. Now, this case of Botelia, the
Lusitanian, is a piratical case, whether the action involves only sub·
jects of your Majesty, or involves subjects only in part, or even
involves only a foreigner. These matters have been set before the
judge of the Admiralty, who has given verdicts in behalf of the Lusi-
tanian. Therefore, the Spanish Ambassador asks that justice be
rendered to the subjects of his King in accordance with the very just
edict of your Majesty, and that an appeal in this piratical case be not
allowed, unless the sum has been deposited.

The Ambassador also thinks that another action is being taken in
this case with reference to subjects of his King, not in accordante
with the law, because there have been assigned to hear the appeal
judges and professors of the municipal law of England, as well as
doctors of the civil law, likewise of England. Now, cases of this
sort between foreigners are judged under the civil law just mentioned,
and this case has been judged under this civil law: and now when we
must see, in the matter of an appeal, if a proper judgment has been
rendered, we must see if a proper judgment has been rendered accord-
ing to that law, according to which judgment ought to have been
rendered. In this situation the Ambassador is not sure what those
who practice another law may think. The Ambassador thinks that
it is impossible for the reply to be made that it is the practice to have
municipal judges also assigned in such a case, for this is done very
rarely, and is only due to the growing power of the municipal
judges. Besides, we shall find that it is the practice in cases which
involve somewhat their municipal law—either in cases where subjects
are concerned, or even foreigners as well. Now, one set of actions
and the actions of one set of people are not brought to bear upon
another set of actions or another set of people. The Ambassador
does not sear the municipal judges or their law, but in defense of
