iv Dedicatory Letter

to bc numbered among the leading families in all Spain, a man
who had filled with distinction all the highest offices in the
Commonwealth. a man who, furthermore, was eminent for his
virtues, his wisdom‚ his distinction, and especially for his kind-
ness. By him my brother was most courteously requested to
assume the advocacy and defense of all those cases which I have
mentioned, and at a salary which did him honor. He obtained
my brother's consent, and that too with the approval and sanc·
tion of the King of Great Britain, in whose realm my brother
was. On taking this step, he found by actual experience that
he had conferred no small advantage on the people of your na-
tion by availing himself of the services of my brother, and he
never [repented] his decision or the judgment which he had
formed of my brother’s diligence, fidelity, uprightness, and ex-
traordinary learning.

My brother had been engaged in these duties for three
years when to the great sorrow, as I have learned, of the most
illustrious ambassador, who had loved him deeply, and of all
good men, he died. Although this misfortune had naturally
afflicted me beyond measure, because of the close relation into
which kinship, studies, and all our pursuits had brought us, still
the personal loss did not move me so much as did the disaster
suffered by the community in the field of Literature, and still
more, of Jurisprudence.

To say nothing of his other writings and studies, which he
in part brought out during his lifetime and in part left unfinished
or roughly sketched3 by his death what a series of most notable
cases has gone, what means have been lost of increasing our legal
knowledge, which seems to be hemmed in and circumscribed
by the too narrow limits of the private law! If we had no other
proof of it, this book, at all events, could furnish, if I mistake
not, very complete and clear evidence. But assuredly the say-
ing is true beyond a doubt, that brilliant men who have been
born to serve letters and the Commonwealth always seem to die
prematurely.

Therefore, most illustrious master, 1 send this book to you,
and I dedicate it to you for the best of reasons, as I think3 ἕο]
