On the Absence of Riqlzt to Take away or Transfer Possession from
leose lVlzo Are Said to Have Bouqlzt Property Stolen by
Pirates and Even to Have Bouqlzt It from the Pirates

The law says: ³ “The woman sentenced for a misdeed to work
in salt pits, seized and taken from there by brigands of a foreign
nation, sold by right of trade, and bought back, resumes her former
status. Furthermore‚ the price is to be paid out of the fiscus to Coc-
ceius Firmus, the centurion.'' From the abstract of this law very
many of the doctors‚ indeed all whom I have seen, teach that those
who buy a stolen article or an article forcibly taken by brigands
recover the price from the owners. ¹³ Caepolla says so in the light of
this law, as does he who has supplemented Caepolla. eThis is what
Jason holds, who refers to Caepolla. So Picus teaches‚ as Menochius
adds to Jason, in the case of 3 fugitive who could have exported the
goods to a place from which the owner could not have recovered
them, “or not so easily.’' Ancharanus, d who teaches the same doc·
trine in the case of one who buys from freebooters‚ holds this view,
even in the matter of recovering interest and damages. ‘³ Others speak
of the ‘⁶ remote '³ hope of recovering such property. fAlciatus fol-
lows this course in saying that the view mentioned would even be quite
“ just,‘’ since, as 3 general thing, the owner could not have obtained

102 the goods mentioned from the brigands by any action at law. g Me-
nochius holds this opinion too. And he cites these writers and several
others, including theologians. Resides, he cites nobody on the other
side, so that we may conjecture that there is no one on the other
side. 11Ι mention in addition Pomatius, Bonifacius‚ and the others
quoted by him, as well as Mantua and Straccha‚ who speaks particu-
larly of pirates. iEven when one ransoms freemen from a robber or
a pirate he may keep the ransomed persons as security until the
amount of the ransom is paid. Therefore‚ it is clear that on this
count possession should not be transferred from those who have
bought stolen property, even from the robbers,

Against this point the confused discussion of Covarruvias should
not be brought, for Menochius actually cites him in support of the
position taken above. Likewise Covarruvias deals in a confused way
with the actio neqotiorum qestorum. lt does not follow that if an
actio neqotiorum qestorum be refused to those who paid the ransom,
