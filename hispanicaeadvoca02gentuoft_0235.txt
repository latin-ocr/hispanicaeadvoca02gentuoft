common view, this view which we mention would be the com-
mon one. ⁵

Furthermore, as to a suspended judgment, the doctors agree that
it is irregular to grant it in a suit for possession. Now, our oppo-
nents in this investigation have recourse to the question of limitations
in the following way: They assert—what is perfectly true—that sus-
pensory action is taken where the loss is not recoverable in a suit for
ownership, has others neatly explain through another suit for pos-
session. Moreover, my opponents go on to make mention of the
irreparable loss suffered by a sailor who merely has the power of
detention and is now deprived of that by an [adverse] decision‚
iand yet in a suit relating to detention the rule is explicitly laid
down that an appeal to suspend the judgment should be granted,
but I reply that the loss here is always reparable or else it is
not loss. Look! Either it is of his own loss on account of passage
money that the sailor speaks—but this passage money has been as-
signed to him so that if he accepts it as being a fair amount, then
he suffers no loss; or, on the other hand, if he does not accept it,
thinking it not a fair amount, he will recover the loss suffered by
an hypothecary action, k by an actio in rem, by a suit to secure owner-
ship. IThus also in a suit involving detention the appeal is denied
should the loss be reparable. Or else the sailor speaks of loss because
he fears the action his employers may take against him, because
property intrusted to him has not been defended. But here either he
has no such instructions from them, so that the loss is not to be con-
sidered, because there is none, or else he has such instructions and will
recover his loss by the institution of a separate suit. Or else the
sailor is speaking of the loss suffered by his employers, in which case
he either has no authority to make such a statement, and, therefore,
will not be heard, or else he has the power, and will in like manner
recover the loss for them.

Then they dare to make a point of the possession of very
valuable property, saying that here lies the cause of no ordinary
prejudice3 mbut they fail to recognize that a suit for possession al-
ways involves merely ordinary prejudice, even though the possession
of some great advantage be involved, even though the property pos-
sessed be of the highest value. Then, too, they strive to demonstrate
the irreparable nature of the loss because, forsooth, an ambassador
is the more powerful personage, adding that he is more powerful
too by reason of his wealth. ¹¹ And yet it has been the usage to call
the more powerful, not him who is wealthier, but rather him who by
virtue of his high office can show the other man a favor involving a
threat. Contardus, who here measures power by wealth, leaves the
matter to the decision of the judge. Why now, I pray, is the Spanish
