CHAPTER XIV

Of ²Makinq an Instrument to Cover α Debt, and of
Releasinq Sureties

TO THE MOST DISTINGUISHED LOPEZ SEDEGNUS

There is no doubt that the most illustrious ambassador may be
held to release his sureties who are soon to leave England, asor
184 Menochius has very recently taught that sureties who are about
to depart must be released, and he cites ten doctors who have
taught the same doctrine, but mentions no one in opposition. But
the question is, whether the ambassador may be held to make an
instrument for them today or give them some other promise that
will release them when they depart, or, as the sureties demand,
within a fixed time. I should think that a request may not be made
for a fixed time, since this would bind the ambassador to an obliga-
tion, to which he is not bound: he is held only in the case of depar-
ture, but he does not seem to be bound to an instrument valid for
this unsettled day of departure, for this introduces either a new
obligation or a more binding one. In neither case is the ambassador
held to execute an instrument, bbecause obligation implies willing-
ness, not necessity, eand because, where the condition of the man
under obligation is made worse, he is not held to execute an instru-
ment. But it is made worse, if the obligation is made more binding.
But if the instrument is sought as a proof only, even then the
ambassador is not held to execute it, since there is no danger in this
case that the proof may be lost, for the law is what binds the ambas-
sador, and the proof furnished by the law, which always has a voice,
cannot be lost. The ambassador is bound by the law to release them
when they go. Why shall the ambassador add his own bond to that
of the law? The law always speaks with a clear voice, and therefore
any other proof is called for without reason. dTherefore this is
the doctrine of Bartolus and the common doctrine, that, when there
is no doubt that proof will be at hand, an instrument may not be asked
for. Ε Action may be taken in advance to make the claim in the case
clear, so that it may be admitted when the time comes. But there is
no need of such a declaration in this case, where the law is clear

and the voice of the ambassador quite so.
The opposite action to this is taken in behalf of the ambassador‚

I say, in the other case, when the ambassador asks for an instrument
