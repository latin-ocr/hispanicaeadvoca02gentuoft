32 Alberico Gentili

But my adversaries have not even considered carefully whether
the law upon which their view rests establishes it. ¹¹ It is not lawful
to carry marbles and other decorations from buildings out of the
city into the country, but it is lawful to take them from one part
of the city to another, and through the middle of the city. The
law states this. Now Archidiaconus gives a very good argument
that it may also be lawful to take an accused person who is under
arrest through a church. However, it is not such a very good argu-
ment after all, because the law merely forbids the defacing of cities.
But a city is in no wise defaced if the works of art mentioned above
are taken through it, unless, perchance, they are of the sort which
Plinv mentions in his ‘⁴ Panegyric,’‘1 when he says that “the roofs
in the city are shaken by the transporting of huge blocks of stone3
the houses are endangered and the temples totter.'’

”¹¹¹¹ Now we grant immunity to a church because of our reverence
for it. ¹¹¹³ This immunity is violated, if force is brought to bear upon
anyone there, within its purview. And this force is used upon the
man who is dragged through a church, and who appeals to the church
for help with eye and voice, though he cannot with his hands. Salyce-
tus, who in commenting on this law writes that what would not other-
wise be permitted‚ is permitted if it occurs merely in transit, links with
other questions the one concerning grain where his argument would
have a more direct bearing. On this point I have expressed myself
in the preceding chapter.

However, here is an argument which leads to the opposite
conclusion. The church does not receive the man free nor does it
put restraint upon him, because the authority which is effective out-
side an inviolable place is not recognized within it. 00 There bonds
confine the hands of the very man who was leading the other in
bonds. With what purpose, pray, except that he who was bound may
go free?

Another argument, too, of Decianus is weak, that the church
protects those who fly to her for refuge and that the man who is
being led through a church does not fly to her for refuge. Now
Ι say that it is not the mere flight of a man to a place of refuge that
brings security, but the sanctity of the place invoked on the spot. Such
a man, says Covarruvias, is really not dragged out by force, but is being
led through the temple after having been arrested outside. But he is
led by force, say I, and consequently is dragged out. ΙΨ It is enough
for him to cry out in the church. In general, the doctrine is that one
may not be taken out.

But if the statement takes cognizance only of those who fiee for
refuge, that arises from the fact that we are commonly wont to
