The Pleas of a Spanish Advocate‚ Bk. I. 71

robs his adversary of proofs is guilty of trickery. Consequently he
has admitted his evil intent. g He shows that he is supporting a dis-
honest cause, etc. »

¹¹ But that constitution of Zeno is vexatious, unjust, in violation
of natural law, in violation of the law of nations; it deprives the other
person of the right of ownership. Therefore its application ought to
be restricted so far as may be, and everybody should always refuse to
recognize the law, etc. lBut it does not hold, unless many accept it;
and many limitations are applied to it. kThat point is much dis-
cussed which concerns the peculiar privilege granted by the law to
the Emperor, as Panormitanus says, a privilege not to be extended
to the King of France. Ι shall set up that limitation against the
King of Barbary, for he does not recognize or hold any part of this

Justinian law, ¹whatever may be said to the effect that in the Turkish .

Empire the highest regard is paid to this Justinian Code and the
greatest weight given it in decisions there. In the case of other Kings
there is no situation of this sort, for their law is not inferior to that
of the Emperor, very often it is even superior.

I will not add several other rather commonly accepted points
which could have been added, because Ι do not wish to dwell longer
on a point that is clear. Stil] I will not fail to say that, even if they
had bought from the public warehouse and from public officials, it
does not follow from that fact that the purchase was made from the
fiscus. The purchase was made there, as the merchants themselves
report, in accordance with the practice of that kingdom. This would
mean that the King should buy everything and that everything should
be bought of the King, as the owner for the moment, and through
some agent of his.

¹¹¹ But the fiscus is bound to sell property as its own, honestly,
not with an ulterior motiVe, if the buyer is to be safe at once. Be-
sides, this sale of the fiscus must be effected through an agent es-
pecially deputed for the purpose, as Alexander states in his opinions.
It is far from true that this sale, informal and nominal in its char-
acter, is enough. The steps mentioned above ought to have been
taken and approved3 yet they were not taken, nor have the merchants
maintained that they were. Consequently the solid foundation based
on the sale by the fiscus on which the advocates on the other side rely
without reason gives way. Menochius reaches the same conclusion
in a case in which he gave an opinion, in discussing the same fundamental
argument raised against him.

Furthermore, in our case I would add that, if this legal principle
is set up to govern the treasury of that land, the pirates will have
indicated to them a very convenient place, which is quite close to the
Spanish lines of trade and occupied by English merchants, where
