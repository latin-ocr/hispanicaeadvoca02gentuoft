do so. ¹⁶ A prince ought to do this even to the extent of using armed
force. This on the second question.

On the third question listen to what Imola says: ¹“ You must
conclude that, if a man has won a civil suit, he will undoubtedly be
able afterward to bring a criminal action.'' Listen to the marginal
note also: ¹¹² ‘⁶ All agree that, if a plaintiff has won in a clvil case, it
is a clear and established fact that a criminal prosecution may fol-
low.'' This third point is not open to question, if the case is one in
which civil action has been brought and sustained to recover prop-
erty, not to inflict punishment, as. all the writers explain in harmony
with the gloss

In the fourth question, whether a man born in Holland, if his
father were naturalized here later on, should be regarded as a sub-
ject here and not allowed to protect himself by Dutch letters of
marque in the matter of booty taken from the Spaniards, I reply
that he is not allowed, for the citizenship spoken of, obtained here
by the father, as stated, would pass to the sons. ²¹ Bartolus, too, held
this opinion, when this question was raised by an actual occurrence,
and other writers follow Bartolus. Under our law citizenship would
pass to the sons, even if no mention is made of them in the father's
naturalization papers, as these writers teach. 0This is the case,
even when the son has not yet given his consent, as Baldus says, what-
ever other writers may say in opposition on this point. I maintain
that this Dutchman, at least, is held as a British subject because of
his own domicile here, pwhich makes a man a subject more than
does either a contract or a delict. The domicile, above all things,
determines the jurisdiction everywhere.

The fifth question is whether Brukus, without depositing the
money which he has been condemned to pay, may be allowed to ap-
peal. The edict of the King forbids this in the case of pirates.
But this man urges insufficient means as his plea. Who should prove
his insufficient means? Brukus himself. ‘1 Castrensis was wrong in
not putting this burden on Brukus. But if he has insufficient means,
is he excused? rLet his body pay the penalty, as the rule stands in
the case of a man brought to trial for a misdeed, who cannot pay
the fine. This is the practice, and it is a good one, as Baldus says.
Therefore, it is allowable in this case not to demand complete proof,
⁵ if the man who is required to furnish the proof should say that he
is poor, because [complete proof] in a way would be impossible,
since we should be dealing with a negative situation. And, therefore,
the opinion expressed by the neighbors is enough, or the oath of a
pious man is enough, etc., and yet this man is not of that sort. t If
it were not a criminal case, he might be excused from making this
deposit on the score of insufficient means.
