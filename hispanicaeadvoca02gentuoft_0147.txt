CHAPTER XXVI
Of an Enqlish Ship Seized for the Use of the Tuscan and leen Lost

There was an English ship off the Tuscan shore, already loaded
and about to sail here to England, when it was seized on the orders
of the Tuscan, unloaded, and sent to war and lost on the return trip.
Two counts are made against our shipowners, who now demand that
they be compensated by the Tuscan for their loss: One, that the
Tuscan promised to make good the loss which was incurred in war-
fare3 but the ship was not lost in this way, and thus the inclusion
of the one [risk] and the exclusion of the other and the foresight
of man would nullify any provision of the law which might have
favored our countrymen. The other count against our clients is
that the lessee is not legally responsible for accidents.

However, on considering the matter more carefully, I side with
our countrymen, ain whose favor, moreover, is the ruling of our
doctors expressly concerning the ship which a prince received for
his own use from his own subjects. This ship was lost in such
a way that the prince is held for the loss. b A prince is obligated to
restore to his people what he has received from them for the public
advantage, whether in war or peace. Now, if a prince is obligated
to his own people, how much more will he be obligated to the sub-
jects of another prince? A prince may take here from his own
subjects with the best of rights, but not so from the subjects of
another.

The two considerations on the other side, mentioned above, have
no weight. The Tuscan's bargain was not with the owner of the
ship or with anyone else who could make that bargain, and it is the
owner who is demanding the return of the ship. Further‚ those rules
about the inclusion of the one [risk] and the foresight of man do
not stand in the way. CThere is the neat reply to both that occur-
rences involving a similar principle are not excluded3 and like them
are all chance occurrences; they are not excluded when some one
[chance occurrence] is expressly mentioned on account of its greater
frequency, and here express mention was made of‘warfare in which
certainly ships are more frequently lost than elsewhere, but there
is no exclusion of other occurrences which in the ordinary and usual
administration of justice would have been included.

The provision of the law would not be nullified if the provision
