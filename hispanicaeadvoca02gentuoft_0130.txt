have a transaction judged in accordance with the law of the place
where it occurred, is altogether natural. ‘³ “I am the master of the
world; the law, of the sea‚’' Antoninus used to reply and, following
Augustus’ example, he would refer those who consulted him to the
Rhodian law, by which maritime questions were settled. Now, as
everyone submits to the civil law, especially in these maritime ques-
tions, as to a sort of law of nationS, everyone will be judged according
to that law to his entire satisfaction. Then hear the words of a
Frenchman‚ f “that the greater part of the law of nations is Roman
law and is alone generally accepted in the Occident.’' ε Also a Span-
iard says: “All those principles of the law of nations formerly
belonged exclusively to the civil law, but they gradually spread, or
quickly flew across to other nationS‚ etc.'’ This we see to be the
case with Roman civil law, t and others too take this view. Or who
does not do so? Who does not see that this is the case? And if
the common law of England is not suited to cases involving foreign-
erS‚ certainly judges who are professors of English common law are
not suited to these cases either3 those suited along with their law
are the professors of English civil law. Now these are the argu-
ments which I advanced in favor of not selecting the judges in this
promiscuous way.

To the opposing arguments, advanced above, I now make reply.
As to the first one, I claim that if regard should be had to the
statutes of the realm, then professors of the common law also should
not be admitted in appeals from a judge of the Admiralty. For-
sooth‚ just as the first judge too should give heed to those statutes,
and just as he is still a professor of civil law, so likewise the appellate
judges may properly be solely professors of civil law.

Now, this answer satisfies the second argument also. For what-
ever that phrase, “our law,‘' in the royal letter may mean, seeing
that the judge appointed to administer it is a professor of civil law,
certainly we should retain similar judges to administer it in the
case under dispute. Or we may go further. Because a professor
of civil law is appointed to administer this “our law ‘’ we have suf-
ficient indication that civil law is meant by that term; otherwise, an
unsuitable judge—which God forbid l—would be appointed to ad-
minister it. The divergent view which our commentators express is to
be explained by the fact that they are not speaking exclusively of the
judge, usince they must indeed know that words, no matter how
improperly used, are to be understood in harmony with the character
of the person to whom they apply—X the rescript to the governor of
Milan is understood, etc.—or else by the fact that our commentators
did not notice that in England not common law but civil law itself
is indicated by the term “civil law,” just as we say: y for they surely
