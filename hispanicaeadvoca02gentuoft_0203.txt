The Pleas of a Spanish Advocate‚ Bk. II. 175

a conclusive reason, or by a sufficiently sound law. ‘s Nay, we must
hold to it, even if the rule of the law or some law should expressly
stand in the way, provided the doctors have seen the law, and have
interpreted it, “even if incorrectly,'’ for there would be a strong
presumption of truth from the writings of so many doctorS, that
either that rule or the law does not establish the case, or that we
are departing from it for some just cause or reason. ⁵⁵ Commonly
accepted opinions today have the same authority as the responses of
wisc men had in olden timeS, and from these it was not lawful for
a judge to depart. They are regarded as law, and they come under
the head of law.

What, pray, are the arguments on the other side? Take the
distinction made by Zasius, and repeated by Covarruvias himself, in
which he defends the common interpretation. The first two reasons
given on the other side by Covarruvias are of no weight. Indeed they
constitute one reason, not two reasons. The defense of ownership,
he says, belongs first to the creditor, so that the debtor cannot keep
him from it. This doctrine we say is not proved by the laws brought
forward by Covarruvias, or by anybody else. The creditor may
maintain, and it would be enough for him to do SO, that the property
was among the goods, was even in the ownership of the debtor
at the time when the pledge was given, but simply that he could not
defend the ownership against the will of the debtor.

The third reason of Covarruvias is also of no weight, for apart
from that case mentioned there the doctrine held by me could indeed
be proved in another manner. ttAlexander indeed replies neither
to the dictum of Bartolus on this point nor to the reasoning. ³³³ “ In
the case of a creditor who is sued it clearly holds,'‘ says Bartolus‚
that a verdict pronounced against him prejudices the case of the
debtor, “for by reason of the very fact that the debtor has handed
over the pledge to him, he seems to have granted him its defense.''
With the dictum of Bartolus also the rest agree, even Alexander
himself. He argues about the reason, and yet he does not rightly
adopt it in the case of a creditor who sues, bbb for it is quite easy
to make a defense. He equivocates in citing the case of a mortgage‚
when a discussion about ownership is presented. He equivocates in
discussing the reasoning of Imola. Imola‘s reasoning is that the
debtor seems to have given his consent to the creditor at the moment
when he does not oppose the litigant, while Alexander argues as if
Imola were talking of a permission granted from the very beginning,
when the pledge was given. But his final recourse is to extrajudicial
and minor points, as if what is said concerning the mandate were
covered in them: for instance, he states the doctrine which applies in
the case of a usufructuary and a creditor.
