liminium in time of peace. Furthermore, in the time of Quintius,
there had been little intercourse between the Greeks and the Romans,
and close relations between them began at that time, as Plutarch
writes. What if you were to say too that the Romans, of whom we
were speaking, came to Greece, to their friends, through the avenues
of trade, and were sold by the Carthaginians? 0 One may maintain
that postliminium does not exist in this case, and that the buyer has
the right of ownership3 with good reason because, if another view
should be held, opportunity might be given the enemy of venting
his rage on the captives whom allies and common friends could not
buy, seeing that in their country the captives would regain their
liberty at once. Or opportunity might be taken to send these cap- 4
tives to barbarous peoples‚ who were more remote, and to other
more savage enemies, from whose land return would be extremely
difficult. p Felynus fitly remarks that ‘⁶ this point applies more particu-
larly where captives taken by infidels are concerned, from the risk
that they may be led by violence or treachery to adopt the infidel's
manner of life.''

Finally against Gama and against his unheard of distinction
one ought to observe that he even speaks against a judgment ren-i
dered by a College [or bench of judges]; <land the decisions of
the Colleges are of more weight even than those of a most distin-
guished jurist. rThis is the point which the Rota of Genoa makes
against the writer of the decisions of the Rota of Avignon, that the
decision was that of the writer, not that of the Rota. Others make
the same objection to a ruling of Afflictis, that he stands opposed
to the rest of the College. Other writers make the same point in
other similar cases.

Now in continuing I would say of Baldus and of the other doctors
that he hesitates, and that all of thern are talking of a proscribed
person, that is of a man regarded as an enemy because of an offense
which he has committed. ⁵ Such a man is comparable to a fugitive.
But they are not talking of an enemy who is waging war, as is the
case here⁴ Between him and the other there are very marked differ-
ences. tLikewise they apply this doctrine when an agreement has
been reached between allies, or when the treaty provides that the
territory of the allies shall be regarded as a unit. And Baldus
says that an alliance has no greater and no less scope than the agree-
ments themselves cover. I maintain too that one situation presents
itself when we are dealing with punishment, which is of course an
unpleasant thing, and which can be inflicted solely in the confines ot‘ an
ally attached to ourselves only; but, when, as in this case, the freeing
[of people and property] is concerned, which is a beneficent act,
another situation comes up for discussion.
