will not endure this attack on the commerce of England. He will
refuse to have the English robbed through his instrumentality of
that which their own King gave them. This same great Duke of
Tuscany will laugh out of court those considerations which make
against this commerce.

Do we not hear that everything else is brought forward against
our clients? A certain argumentation of ours against Hanseatic
people shall not here in the present suit be twisted against us; in
this present case, I say, where commerce would be blocked forever‚
if the reason for hostility toward the Turk were felt by the Tuscan
to last forever3 and it would be blocked, not by war, but—the ab-
surdity of it—-by mere raids; and it would be blocked when there
is absolutely no question of Tuscany's safety‚ etc. Now all the
contrary considerations were present in that Hanseatic case.
f The doctors are very prudent in saying that an argument based on
precedents is weak for this reason, among others, that we do not know
the exact circumstances of the cases cited.

Then we have the consideration that our King does not have
any perpetual enemieS‚ so that it would not be fair for him to be bound
against the perpetual enemies of others, since the Tuscan is not
obligated in this way to our King. Or, if our King has perpetual
enemies, pray, will the Tuscan consent to be obligated to our
King against them, against the Roman Pontiff?
