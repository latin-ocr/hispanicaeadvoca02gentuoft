time), we should have regard for the decis sion which, as ours did,
suspends judgment 1n the suit for ownership.

Again, our opponents read us a different decision [on the point]
whether, where questions are entangled‚ appeal should be taken from
the whole decision, that 18, from that part of it as well which bears
on the suit for possession—I mean where the questIOns are entangled
in the sense that they are here, or where they may be so called by
equivocation. 1² Appeal is taken always from the part of the decision
that touches the question of ownership, not from that part which
touches the question of possession, as my learned authority explains
here with great learning and at great length. XThis is the view of
it taken by Menochius in cases where the two questions can be
separated, because in such cases the useful cannot be vitiated by the
useless3 and, consequently, as Cynus says, no change with reference to
a suit for possession is ever found. So much for these cases.

But my opponents will lend ear to another who says that the
decision is clearly unjust, y that one may appeal from such a decision,
because an evident injustice is like a nullity. Then, too, they speak
of a nullity, Ζ and of a nullity too one may speak here, ³² but, as Me-
nochius and others write, from the action taken also we should be
perfectly clear on these points. Now, I have, I confess, considered
just what sort of injustice of this character could exist here, but have
found none.

Furthermore, the judge may pass over the other points which
are not involved in the action under consideration3 the proofs may be
heard by the judge in camera; the judge may pass from the replies
of the defendant to his own interrogations. So Contardus explains
it. bb The whole subject-matter of the proofs lies at the disposal
of the judge. Thus there is no injustice which is evident, none which
is palpable‚ as they say. Then, too, in regard to the nullity which
they mention, I took under consideration ⁰⁶ what Baldus has in his
“ Replies‚” namely, that if the libel involved also a question of own-
ership (as it does not in this case), and the judge (as he does here)
should confine his pronouncement to the question of possession, then
the decision would be null, because not in keeping with the writ nor
given on the points involved in the suit. And, Baldus goes on to say,
it makes no difference if the judge reserves his decision on the question
of ownership, because this reservation is a sort of precaution taken by
the judge and an embarrassing of the suit. So much for the question
of nullity.

But, on the other hand, no matter how the action in the suit for
ownership was taken, the judge should have pronounced on it also;
still, if by any chance he has not done so, his decision will not on
that account be void. no matter what Baldus may have said.
