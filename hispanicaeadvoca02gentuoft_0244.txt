CHAPTER XX
Of the Sale of Perishable Goods

The request made by the illustrious Lord, who is in possession
213 of the sugar, that permission be granted him to sell it, has a certain
justification, because perishable goods ought to be sold, and sugar is
a commodity of this sort. ἃ Those goods are called perishable which
cannot be kept by mere keeping, that is, those from which no profit
is derived by the keeping while they themselves are being kept.
Those goods are called perishable which cannot be kept in their
natural excellence “beyond three years‘’ without being spoiled by
the lapse of time and becoming worse. bWe offset these two things
in this way, namely, those goods which can be kept without great
inconvenience, and, secondly, those goods which it is advantageous to
sell at the earliest possible time. Under this head fall fruit, oil,
wine, grain, and similar articles about which the doctors have ex-
pressed these views in common, and of which they have given illus-
trations. Accordingly, it would be necessary to come to the same
conclusion regarding sugar, which is not only a perishable product,
but would deteriorate with keeping, as experts have testified in the
matter. ⁰ Articles of this kind ought to be sold, to use the words of
the doctors in this connection.

Now, in our case there is nothing uncertain. In their case there
would be the question, who has to do with the selling, while here
undeniable right seems to favor his Lordship. d The man who is in
possession for the purpose of preserving a thing is the one who sells
things of this sort. Therefore‚ he too who has some similar claim to
possession will also effect the sale. eThat man has the sole tenure,
and our client certainly does not have less. f Further, that case and
ours seem to be marked as on a par with reference to the question
whether perishable goods should be sold, whence too one would not be
wrong in inferring that they are also on a par with reference to this
question, who has to do the selling. g But note the observation of the
Imperial Privy Council, where the civil law is followed, as it is here
before the bar of the Admiralty. This observation is to the effect
that goods of this sort should be sold by the man who is holding thern.
And thus there can be no lengthy question here either.

However, there succeeds another question, namely, how· those
goods should be sold. Undoubtedly at as high a price as possible,
