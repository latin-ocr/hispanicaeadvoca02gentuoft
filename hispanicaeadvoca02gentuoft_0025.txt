To the most illustrious and learned man,
His Lordslzip Scipione Gentili, Iurisconsult,
Counselor of tlte Commonwealtlz of Nuremberq, most distin-
quislzed Predecessor‚ and beloved Friend and Colleaque,

Concerninq the IVritinqs of his Brother, likewise a Man of the
qreatest Renown, a Jurist of tlte §reatest Eminence, His Lord-
slzip Alherico Geumi, Reqius Professor and Royal Advocate‚ etc.

Most brilliant and splendid figure among jurists, chief glory of
this Lyceum, Scipione: when the report first came from Britain that
thy brother Alberico—that great man—had left this tragic-comic

stage of life, and that thy father, Matteo, had followed along that

road which all mortals must once tread, as well kings and the dis-
tinguished scions of kings, as the dregs of the common herd to whom

birth has been granted, I remember that thou didst seem almost over-

whelmed by the violence of thy grief and that thou didst seem to
be leading a bitter life, robbed as it were by his death of half of
thyself—robbed of half of thy heart and life.

This was the power of love and the force of nature to which
even the wise man yields obedience: his fiber is not of horn and flint,
and he does not war against nature, as if he were Gigas.

Now thou hast yielded enough to grief and to mourning which
has its own limits, as all things have. Now the mighty queen, reason,
comes forth, and brings the dead to life, to life, I say, through his
many great services and through his books which cover all the fields
of learning, for by his books he has gained for himself a second
life even in this world, not to speak of life in the other world, which
God gives freely to mortals, and has already given and will give
henceforth to Alberico, in addition to a crown of blessedness.

But with what praise will those learned in the law deservedly
attend thee, Gentili, most distinguished glory of this body, and what
thanks will they pay thee for thy deserts in bringing to light the post-
humous writings of thy brother, an earnest of which at this moment
are the “ Spanish Pleas '' which we owe to thine industry. Pray, let
us owe to thee in the future more writings of this sort, in which the
fame of each of the Gentili flourishing beyond the grave may prove
the concord of brothers, concord which is the dearest blessing of life. ²
