CHAPTER VII
Of the Proof of [qnoranoe and Knowledqe

The rule ais that we take for granted, not knowledge, but
ignorance of another's act, especially if the person acting is a long
way off. b Therefore, knowledge must be established by most cogent
proofs, since the rule and presumption of law oppose taking it for
granted. cExact knowledge with all the characteristics peculiar to
that act, full, definite knowledge must be proved. dIgnorance is
proved from the very fact that the contrary is not proved, and thus
there is a new method of establishing a point, as Andreas de Bamlo
says. eBut as an act of supererogadon, the other party can prove
his ignorance, and indeed by his own oath, and he must be listened
to. This is undoubtedly the case.

Still the following principle too would be true that, f whether it
be knowledge or ignorance, it must be alleged and proved by him
who bases his purpose, either in suing or in taking an exception,
upon knowledge or ignorance. Thus it is expressly against a third
person opposing a res iudicata that it would be enough to bring
this knowledge up against him, and that he would have to prove
his ignorance. He would be a stupid person who should take an
exception against this third party on the score of'knowledge‚ for
in that case he would himself have to prove the knowledge. This
Villapandus, a very learned Spanish jurisconsult, says. Come, act
generously3 prove the knowledge. g It is a well-accepted principle that
knowledge is proved by indications and inferences, by one witness
even, and, therefore, in proving it, it is true that a very exact proof
is required. Indeed, the matter is difficult to prove. Therefore, it
would be proved just like any other matter difficult to prove.

Still, so far as concerns three or four of these people‚ it is quite
certain that those who were always in⁴ the company of the navigator
knew of the whole dispute with the navigator, although they said
nothing. h It is taken for granted that those who are present know
what is being done on the spot, especially what is being done publicly‚
especially what concerns themselves, and especially what lasts long
enough to attract the attention, as is the case here. iIt is taken for
granted that a serious matter has become known to “ everybody''
whom it can “ in any wise ’⁹ injure. k Then also it is taken for granted
that those who are absent are informed, owners by their agents, says
