taken may go on to take further action, until the soundness of the
appeal is cleared up, 'm as Aretinus urges in opposition, and Felynus
follows him—he was his teacher-—for they do not reply to the rea·
soning of Panormitanus, and it does not follow that an execution may
also be made. An execution is different from the other measures, and
goes beyond the ulterior remedies. But this is another question.

The last argument does not stand in our way, 0⁰ for the decision
mentioned is in accordance with the law of France which does not
grant the review of an interlocutory decree that causes irreparable
injury. From that rule would come the rule forbidding the grant
of a review in other circumstances, but a rule covering all cases
would not be established. Consequently, since the arguments on the
other side have been refuted, our third argument stands.

But since there are people who would take their stand mainly
on the words of the laws which seem always to forbid review, let them
still hear pp that the laws are talking of petitions‚ not to secure justice,
but of petitions obtained by favor, by solicitation, by using elaborate
means to secure a favorable decision‚ by the use of powerful influ-
ence. qq Thus a petition in the strict sense presupposes favor, and
that I am not dealing with now, but I am contending for the other
kind of a petition whose purpose is to secure justice, which may be
called an appeal, a restoration. An appeal from an interlocutory
decree pronounced even by a Prince or the senate of a Prince‚ is not
forbidden. ‘r In a review of this sort, granted to secure justice, it
would seem that an execution would be delayed. Even a request for
a review in this situation would delay it. SSThose who say there is
no delay are talking of a petition granted as a favor. Perhaps under
the civil law which we are following here the sam-e principle would
not apply to the delay, as is set forth by Aretinus and others with
regard to canon law. tt Under the canon law the jurisdiction of the
judge is not suspended by an appeal from an interlocutory decree.
Why should it be suspended for cases which would never be finished,
inasmuch as under that law it is allowable to appeal from every inter-
locutory decree? But under civil law, inasmuch as an appeal from
an interlocutory decree may not be given, except in a very few cases,
reason does not stand in the way of a stay. When an appeal is given
from an interlocutory decree causing irreparable injury, reason will
allow a stay, that justice may not have granted the appeal to no
purpose. Why, has not an appeal been taken from the verdict which
followed? Of the nullity of such a verdict have I not spoken? Con-
sequently, execution of it will not take place. Thus I have spoken
again on the sixth point urged against us.

I speak now of our same fourth argument explicitly in
favor of a petition for a review, based upon Decianus and others.
