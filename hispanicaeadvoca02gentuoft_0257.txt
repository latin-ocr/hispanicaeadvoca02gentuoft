CHAPTER XXVI

Of tlze Nullity of a Decrec

Illustrious Lord:

A decision, anull and void, is not called a decision; it is not
executed3 nay, if it has been executed, the execution is to be revoked.
b But this is null and void, in that it has a palpable error through its
relation to the petition; for the petition seeks such and such boxes
and the decis10n pronounces with regard to others. CA sentence
given with reference to things not sought after is null and void. And
the nullity will the more hinder the execution in our case, since
it concerns the retention of those boxes by him from whom they are
to be received. d “ So beneficent is the right of retention that it pre-
vails even against the execution of the decision. And retention is
especially privileged‚'’ as Menochius says, following others who un-
doubtedly are speaking of a valid decision, so that they would cer-
tainly hold the same with reference to an invalid one.

And this argument is not weakened if one should reply that
the error in this case is in the name, as it were, of the boxes and e that
this error cannot vitiate the decision; for the answer is that such does
seem to be the case, should there be really no doubt about the thing
referred to, and yet there is such doubt in this case. Then, too, let
no one reply that this error can be emended by the judge, fbecause
no decision can be emended or corrected by the judge, even on the
spot3 no definitive decision, such as this one surely is, by which the
whole business is defined. What then if the decision was not given
in a regular manner? Regularity does not change its essence, but
lack of regularity makes the act ineffectual: and, therefore. this deci-
sion is null and void, even on this score of the lack of regularity.

And let no one either begin by making a distinction for me be·
tween a regular judge and one specially appointed, as if the special
appointee alone were unable to remedy the nullity of his decision:
for the regular judge, though he is able to give a second decision, is
not on that account able to emend a null and void decision of his.
Let the same judge give a second decision, that is our request‚ but
let him also hear us, let him suffer himself to be instructed; let him
give us the opportunity of cross-questioning the witnesses of our
opponents‚ let him see our proofs; g or it will be said that the decision

was given in haste, and this we say in the present case of the decision
