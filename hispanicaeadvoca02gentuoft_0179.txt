, lee Pleas of a Spanislz Advocate, Bk. II. 151

iBesides, the man who is under obligation to prove the exist-
ence 01 311 obstacle is also under obligation to prove that he has shown
diligence‚ and that he has also made an 611011, and that he has also
striven with all his power to overcome the obstacle, and yet has not
been able to overcome it and to carry the action through. Also
proof should be given that he tried several times, and not on one day
only, to weather the storm and make a landing. Further‚ there
should be a public statement several times of the insuperable char-
acter 01 1116 obstacle, as all those rules apply expressly to chance occur-
rences. These rules it would be safer to follow than to follow the
general distinctions.

But come, let this captain prove the obstacle, and we will not
call for public announcements. VVas he, ¹³ as all sailors regularly do, 147
governed by the wind, tacking in this way and that, until the storm
passed by and a more favorable breeze came back? It has not been
proved and no attempt has even been made to prove that it was
necessary to 601116 11616, 10 England. Furthermore, [it has not been
proved that] he could not have gone to some point in the Kingdom 01
Portugal. To this country, to this country 1113 6011136 certainly lay,
since the end aimed at is learned from the route taken, land the
man who carries merchandise by unusual mutes, and who carries it
by other 1011163 leading to forbidden places, is thought to be going
to forbidden places. Would any storm bring him 11616 110111 111036
islands and not allow him to go to the 16311113 01 Portugal? mA
single storm does not rage everywhere, and the same storm coming
upon a- shIp in a (1111616111 part of the sea does not drive it to the same
place. Indeed 1011163 by sea and by land are 01 60111111011 knowledge.
From those islands one goes directly through England to Holland,
and, therefore, although the existence 01 301116 3101111 may have been
proved, still this storm, of which they talk, has not been proved.

Let the navigator produce the formal papcrs which he has.
At once the whole matter and the triCkery in this 6336 will be clear.
¹¹ Publication should certainly be made to the fiscus or to 311 agent
in behalf of the fiscus, even for the purpose of establishing the inten-
tion of the fiscus. ⁰ Navigators ought to produce such documents—
that is the common opinion—especially if there be suspicion 01 any
fraud, as there is suspicion here, 110111 1116 aforementioned course 01
1116 ship‚ that the goods are being carried to another place than that
to which the navigator says that they were destined.

The same suspicion arises when all the facts are concealed from
1116 royal ambassador on his making an inquiry even about the duty
due the King. “He is doing wrong who avoids the light.'' p It is
also a “ common'‘ vice to withhold fraudulently tariffs and duties.
This suspicion attachcs also to the very owners 01 1116 merchandise‚
