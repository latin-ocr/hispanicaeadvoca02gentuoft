are limits laid down> by conventiom and what applies to the former
does not [necessarily] apply to the latter. And here we should fol-
low the limits laid down by right, according to which peace and treaty
agreements ought to be definitely understood, since other limits, after-
ward fixed, were not then in mind. Further‚ an edict is not retroac-
tive: f ‘⁶ It is axiomatic that laws and constitutions put their impress
upon future transactions and that they are not applicable to past
acts.‘’ Nor is this declaration of the King’s rights (gand thus to
be accepted the more readily) made in an edict, but it is an entirely
new arrangement, and law. hFor a declaration introduces noth-
ing new and changes nothing; but this edict does change much, if
the territorial power of the king really extends much beyond those
boundaries as now fixed. iOne might also reply that all authorities
express the opinion that a declaration is of no effect where it works
to the prejudice of the other party, as it would have done in this
case of the intercepted ship, for which justice had been sought in
accordance with the common law, and at the same time in accord-
ance with the special peace agreement by the terms of which each
sovereign was to allow no violence to be offered the subJects of the
other in his territory. Justice was sought more particularly in accord
with this special agreement on the ground that it would not be proper
to curtail the obligation of a contract, whereas this obligation would
now be curtailed if there should thus be offered a curtailed territory
within which alone our King were able to aflord protection to Span-
iards.

Nor again is my position shaken by the objection that for a long
time previous to this and by a usage of long standing those boun·
daries which have now been expressly fixed by the edict have been
observed in questions of this kind. For, to pass by the chief difficul-
ties that are raised by the attempt to make usage apply here, you
certainly will not find that kthe intention of our King in entering
into the treaty took any account of that usage, if there was any
usage, or even of the ancient statute which is said to apply here; and
naturally, since these matters are not of mutual applicability or known
to the other sovereign party to the treaty, ¹perhaps they are not
known even to our own King, since they are mere questions of fact, and
in a new kingdom. ‘¹¹ So, too, is a parallel defense urged, whether a
church may be without an incumbent, or have a prelate immediately ap-
pointed. What has our own peculiar English law to do with for-
eigners? Likewise, as the proverb has it, there is much English law
locked up in the breasts of our judges, but foreign kings will not
suffer themselves to be confined there. nThat was a noble act of
the Romans, in allowing the AEtolians to return to the status quo ante,
because they had been deceived in a treaty by the consul AEolius‚
