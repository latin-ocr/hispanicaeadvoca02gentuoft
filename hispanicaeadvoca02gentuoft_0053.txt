The Pleas of a Spanislz Advocate, Bk. I. 25

secured by them, in order that aid may be rendered to the Spaniards,
who are likewise their friends? Ambrose, the theologian and
jurisconsult, says “no '' on this point, because if one cannot be aided
without injuring another, it is better, not to help the one, than to
vex the other. gThere is a common saying that one altar ought
not to be uncovered in order to cover another.

I also pondered the followings words: ¹³ “ If one has the right to
bury his dead, he is not [to be] prevented from exercising it; but he
is evidently prevented from exercising the right, if he be prevented
from carrying the body to the place of burial, or be kept off the road.''
More fully: ¹“ It is ordered that corpses be not detained or molested
or hindered from being transported through the territories belonging
to towns.'' And more fully still: “That they have deserved no
punishment, who have carried through villages or a town the body of a
man who has died on a journey, although such a step ought not to be
taken without the permission of those who have the right to give that
permission.’' It is then an offense which carries no penalty, ¹³ as the
gloss to the passage adds. And so it may not be lawful for the Dutch
to cross here with the booty in question without the permission of our
king, but if they should try to cross without this permission, they
would not suffer punishment, certainly not this exceedingly severe
punishment of losing the booty. At least the right should be granted to
them which is given even to thieves who betake themselves with stolen
property into another territory, ¹ for thieves in such a case are expelled.
With this limitation, therefore, let the punishment stand.

These are the considerations which Ι myself brought forward
against the side for which I am the advocate, but still they presented
no real difficulty, and Ι defended my side in this way: These cap-
tured possessions have not yet been made the property of the enemy,
and therefore here in the territory of the king, who is the friend
of both parties, no force should be brought to bear on the things
captured. Now no one would deny that force is brought to bear on
the captives and their captured property, if these captives with their 23
property be taken from here against their will. For force is brought
to bear not only at the time when a person and when a thing is
seized by force, but then also when they are taken along by force.
¹³¹ Force is said to be used in both cases, both when a thing is seized
and when it is detained, as the commonly accepted opinion goes.
¹¹ Thus theft often involves a continued act of stealing; thus there is
often a continuation of theft; thus we speak of a continuous stealing
on the part of a thief, even though the thing has been taken but once.
oAnd so Barbatia says that a thief who flees with stolen property
to a church is said to commit a new theft there because of the newly
occurring act of stealing, and, therefore, he may be even taken from
