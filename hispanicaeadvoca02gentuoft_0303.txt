In preparing this Index our purpose has been to identify and arrange in
alphabetical order all the authors and books, jurists and juristical compositions
mentioned by Gentili directly or indirectly in the text of the His-punica Advocatio
or in the marginal notes thereto. The names of a few men and the titles of a
few books can not be determined with certainty because they are not to be found
in any accessible biographical or bibliographical records2 or because Gentili’s
references are so obscure as to prevent us from identifying with confidence the
works cited, but a large majority of them, we hope, have been made out correctly.

Unless the information was unavailable or the author too well known to
need comment, a notice of his nationality and date follows each writer’s name;
then, if he has been cited in the text, the pages of such citation are given in
arabic numerals; finally comes a list of his works to which reference has been
made in the marginal notes, the location of these references being indicated by
book, chapter, and letter. The letter is followed by a numeral if it has been
used before in the same chapter. &Vhere the notes have been grouped at the ends
of chapters in the translation, a doubled letter takes the place of the numeral.
Thus ΙΙ, 1, n 2 in the list of authors given below will be II, 1, nn at the end of
a chapter.

To identify any marginal reference the following suggestions may be of use.
Observe in the collections at the ends of chapters how the separate notes under
any letter are marked off by semicolons. The first abbreviation in the note is
usually the initial letters of the author's name. The index will show it in
expanded form. If the rest of the note involves the abbreviation of a bookutitle,
this will be identified easily by a glance at the works accredited to the author.
ln the case of a reference to the Civil or Canon Law, the reader should keep in
mind the method employed by Gentili in referring to thern as explained in the
prefatory remarks in this volume.

But sometimes Gentili omits the general rubric in citing a law or even a
section in a law in the Digest, Code, or Institutes. The following laws or
sections so cited in the notes may be identified thus:

l. actus is probably D. 50. 17. 77 l. Gallus is probably D. 28. 2. 29
l. a divo Pio ‘¹ ‘⁴ D. 41. 1.15 l. lecta “ ⁴⁴ D. 12. 1. 40
