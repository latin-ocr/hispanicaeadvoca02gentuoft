but that he has a better one to adduce. And Ripa cites the law which
we have quoted.

Without purpose would the law have said, “they have captured
and have taken to a point within their lines,'' if it meant that to have
made a capture is enough. ¹² All the words of the law ought surely to
be taken into account. Now a copula, this is the popular word, implies
the union of the things copulated. The law which Angelus puts for-
ward ordains that the thing must be safe if it is effectually in the posses-
sion of the captors‚ And, therefore, it means that it has been brought
within the fortified lines, where at last it is safe. 0 The words must be
understood of effective action, as likewise the common rule requires.
And so, if a statute gives a reward to one who captures a proscribed
person, the meaning is when the claimant has made an effective capture
and has brought the captive before his superior, To acquire property
the Dutch are bound to have made an effective capture of it; but
they have not made an effective capture of that which they have not
yet brought within their fortified lines.' Consequently, they have not
acquired this property. So Ripa is on our side and Angelus also
supports us, Ρ as does Jason. Ripa cites the glossator also, q Now
the glossator distinctly remarks that a thing does not belong to the
enemy who takes it unless it has been brought within his fortified lines.

Salycetus who is cited makes the same statement: “Notice‚’'
he says, “that persons do not belong to the captors‚ until after they
have been taken within the fortified lines of the enemy, and the same
thing is true of all other movable property that, before it has
been brought within the fortified lines of the enemy, it does not belong
to them, but remains under the same ownershIp as before its cap-
ture, for with respect to things the reasoning is the same in this
case.’‘ Now these golden words concerning property have been at
my disposal against my adversaries, who had the hardihood to treat
the case of captured persons and captur-ed things separately. s For,
although in this connection the laws themselves teach the same doc-
trine concerning the acquisition of ownership in both cases, and
concerning postliminium in both cases, still I should scarcely have
established my point, if Ι had not brought to bear these words of
Salycetus to that effect.

Now let us mention here our other authorities. SThe other
Angelus, when he finds the statement. property taken from the enemy
becomes ours at once, remarks: “Interpret this statement in ac-
cordance with that law, which requires the property to be brought
within fortified lines.’‘ He teaches the same doctrine with reference
to postliminium, holding that it is not enough to have escaped from
the enemy unless one gets back to his own people‚ because the law
requires the satisfaction of both conditions. Thus the other
