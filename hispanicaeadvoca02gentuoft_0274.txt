a doctor who is dead and who has been a man of unusual authority.
However, in the case of one who is dead the situation is less con-
vincing, because the usage may have varied after his death. Now,
so far as the place is concerned, rDecianus himself says that one
ought to trust such a doctor only concerning the place in which he

lives.
But, to resume, in the discussion in support of the same view, and

in opposition to Castrensis, he also cites ⁵ Decius, where Decius says
it is commonly held, that we should never say that a contract is made
in writing in accordance with the wish of the parties concerned, un-
less it is specifically arranged by them that the contract shall not other-
wise be valid. In that connection he replies to the dicta of Castrensis,
and reaches the conclusion that his opinion is not correct. In that
instance, however, the case is such that Sejus is under obligation to
sell to Titius, and is held to make a paper for the sale, but Decianus
says that the obligation to sell is complete before the paper has
been drawn up, even if the condition is not satisfied. This has no
bearing on the question, for a paper did not have to be made to
cover that obligation. He says likewise that the dictum of Castrensis
does not hold unless the substance of the contract has been withheld;
that it does not hold also in cases where regard is paid merely to the
custom of making instruments, and that to the custom regard seems
to have been paid in cases of doubt. Still I doubt this, since it is in
contractual, not in executive, matters that we imagine words spoken.
He remarks too that when it was said that an instrument is to be
made to suit the meaning of the said sound-minded Titius, that was
said to the benefit of Titius. Therefore‚ one ought not to twist the
statement and deny that the condition is satisfied. This argument is
weak in the case of an onerous contract, where the burden may fall
on Titius, if the sale were completed beforehand.

Two other points which he has are true: first, that a notary
may not finish an instrument in advance of the time set by the parties
concerned; secondly, that a sale would be complete before the in-
strument was finished, if the whole price was to have been paid in
advance, for the payment of the price proves a completed sale,
although it would be absurd to have the price paid before [the pur-
chase is completed]. This may be a limitation of the view of

Castrensis.
But this very Castrensis is quoted in a certain opinion in op-

position to himself, when he remarks on the aforementioned law
contractns² that in that case the parties concerned had expressly
arranged to regard nothing as settled until the writing had been
finished. Consequendy, Decianus infers that, since the doctor is
