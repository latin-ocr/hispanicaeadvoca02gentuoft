CHAPTER HI
Of Instructed lVitnesses

Itis certain ²¹ that witnesses may be induced by entreaties to give
testimony, provided there be no corruption. ¹³ In the same way, too,
it is the instruction of witnesses with a view to corrupting them, not
their instruction by way of warning, that is forbidden. Roffredus
says in his pamphlets, on the title De Senatus Consulto Libonian0‚¹
that a witness instructed by a party to speak the truth would not be
called suborned. Over this dictum Baldus rejoices, as Felynus ob-
serves. ⁰ But Baldus, as Odofredus says, remarks that an advocate
ought not to give witnesses wrong instructions, but he easily is able in
good faith to instruct them so that they may know how to speak
the truth‚ and he adds that he has done this many times.

‘¹ He too, as well as others, makes the distinction that either the
witness was instructed to make a positive or a negative statement,
when it would be a case of subornation, or else, when the witness
wished to make a positive or a negative statement, he was instructed
to adopt a true and suitable form of narration, when it would not be
a 6356 of subornation. eA witness trained to express himself in
suitable words is not said to be suborned‚ as Baldus also says else-
where. Aretinus says too that witnesses in disagreement‚ brought
forward by one and the same party, are not brought into agreement
[in the trial], in order to prove a point, because the party bringing
them forward has itselr‘ to blame, inasmuch as it has not instructed its
witnesses beforehand concerning the truth, or has not known before-
hand what they were going to say.

Here I would note that a witness, however, ought not to prom·
ise anything definite, for in that case he should be rejected according
to another distinction made by Baldus on this point. fVVhat, what
kind, how much: those are definite points. To have made a state-
ment in advance would not prejudice the case because that is not to
have made a promise. However, it would not prejudice a case to
have made a promise, if it is lawful to instruct witnesses, as the dictum
allows. Such a promise is usually of no value, g since witnesses would
“ often '' make a promise and not keep it: they would say one thing
to a party concerned, another to the judge; it is to the party that
they would lie “more frequently.'' ¹³ Still the party, too, which has
