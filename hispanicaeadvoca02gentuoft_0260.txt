232 Alberico Gentilz‘

have not yet disgorged this prey. What if this man should be either

unwilling or unable to face a lawsuit alone, and should either corne to

a settlement with the freebooters or else leave a part of the property
to them? The ambassador cannot submit to a procedure which would

allow the enemy to acquire something. Let his Worship, the judge,
hear this one point, if it pleases him: This owner of the eight boxes
ought by right to lose them all, because he orders them to be handed
over to the Dutchman. Such are the laws of the King of the Spains,
which, the illustrious ambassador will say, should be observed against
his subject. The ambassador, so far as he is concerned‚ I say, will
acquiesce in a decree of his Worship, the judge‚ under which these
eight chests are declared to belong to the plaintiff. He will acquiesce,
I say, so far as he is concerned because he does not want the slightest
thing for himself; but still he thinks that ear should be given to the
remaining owners of the remaining property, the owners os the prop-
erty completely spoiled, who perchance will seek a share from
what is left and from this owner of the eight boxes. His VVor-
ship‚ the learned and experienced judge, cannot be unaware
that a share should be given to those who have lost their own,
in order that other people’s property may be saved It will be
said that many chests have been left to those who recovered the booty
from the freebooters and, accordingly for those boxes there will
be a share given. The illustrious ambassador will acquiesce in a decree
under which those eight boxes are declared to belong to the plaintiff‚
but it is not possible for him under the law to assent to an order that
these boxes be “now ‘⁹ handed over “to the Dutchman.'’

Accordingly, he seeks from his Worship, the judge, either that
the interlocutory decree be revoked, or that it be published and be sus-
pended so far as handing over the property is concerned. The illus-
trious ambassador seeks to have the subjects of his own sovereign kept
far from such unseemly‚ unjust‚ and most disagreeable lawsuits with
himself. To think of the ambassador summoned into court without
permission by the subjects of his King! To think of the ambassador
doing wrong to others! To think of a suit against the ambassador,
the sole author here of the action for recovery!
