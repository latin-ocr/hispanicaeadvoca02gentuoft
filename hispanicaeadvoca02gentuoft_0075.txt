CHAPTER X

Of the Ship leat Makes a Raid under Convoy of Another

The decree of our King (i.e., Spain’s) says that, when a ship
has more Britons than foreigners‚ it is to be regarded as piratical‚
if it annoys any friend of the King. In this case a sloop manned by
Britons alone, but under the convoy of a Dutch ship captured a
Spanish vessel. Shall the booty be wrested from the Britons on the
ground that they are pirates, or shall it be left untouched on the
ground that it was won by the Dutch?

Now, not the Britons, but rather the Dutch, who afforded them
protection with their large ship, appear to have captured it.. ἃ For
example, he who was present with a weapon when a crime was com-
mitted, even though he did nothing else, is said to have been an ac-
cessory to the crime. So, likewise, in the case of this booty, we shall
find that the Dutch ship played this part. At the very least, then, a
share of the booty will fall to the Dutch ship, and indeed a much
larger share than to the British ship, just as the Dutch vessel is
herself much larger, and, as the leader, of much more consequence.
bThen, too, this law of war has been regarded as just from the
remotest antiquity, namely, that they also should receive a share of
the booty who have held the enemy in check, and that those who have
captured the booty should not hold all of it, since it was realized
that the others too had played a part in securing it. In harmony with
that just and ancient law, the pontifical ordinance provides that even
the monks who do not toil, but devote themselves to literature, shall
enjoy the labors of others. Besides, this fixed but unwritten lawr is not
violated and the Dutch are not injured by the edict of the King which
we mentioned, for this case does not come within the purview of that
edict, because it speaks of one ship where the majority of t'ne crew
are Eritish. But this is a case where we have two ships united and
the whole number of Dutch much greater. cThe ships are like one
body, just as a fleet is one body. ‘³ Of one body are the clergy who are
absent on necessary business and those who are in residence. Yes,
even the former class are regarded as residents in the eyes of the law.
And accordingly, the edict favors the Dutch rather than the Span-
iards, inasmuch as in that company there were more Dutch than
Britons. The Dutch will add—what is perfectly true—that the pur-
pose of the King's edict was to check trickery which, it was asserted,
