CHAPTER XXIII
leether tlze Pztrclzasers of Plunder NIay Keep It for Themselves

The English merchants would refuse on any condition to restore
to the former owners the captured property they have bought. Ob-
serve that they bought it at Tunis, and in Tunis it is not the
law that buying even from pirates themselves is forbidden. But
now, if the law or custom of Tunis‚ whichever you call it, did give
judgment in keeping with the desire of these merchants, who can doubt
that here too the same judgment would have to be given? *In con-
sidering the details and merits of a case, according to the common
and universal view, the place where the transaction occurred is al-
ways taken into consideration. But these merchants bought from
the highest Tunisian officer, who had, moreover‚ the administration
of the main fiscus. Accordingly at Tunis they would have been safe,
and accordingly they would be safe everywhere. ¹³ He is at once safe
who buys from the fiscus of any prince whatsoever, according to
the more commonly accepted view3 ⁰,or whatever the law may be,
it is certain that this ιε the actual practice, and such actual practice is
regarded as law. Nor do princes suffer their authority to be ques·
tioned. <¹1 do not dare, says Baldus m this connection, to assume a
lordly air and speak against the power of princes. Ι arn not the
man to desire, says he, “to re-spade ‘’ the world. Now, too, some
Englishman may say to me: “If the merchants had bought these
wares in the open market of England‚ would they have had to make
restitution to the owners, whether they were Venetians or English-
men or others?'’ eThe law of England‚ as I hear it, says no. Why
do Ι say the law of England? Elsewhere, too, I doubt not, the law 1s
to this effect. ¹³ It 1s at Padua. What! do we say with certain men that
the law 1s not valid?

Fools though we be, we know g that actual practice, even though
not established in law, is regarded exactly like law. ¹¹ The custom of
a place makes lawful the contract which would otherwise be unlawful.
iThat sort of contract is legal which is frequently used in a district
by good men and lawful merchants. Why then, pray, shall they
restore these wares bought from the Turkish fiscus?

[My opponents] will say k that I said in another case with ref-
erence to the fiscus of the King of Barbary, that only where the fiscus

of one‘s own prince is involved does that legal principle, the law
