from the assault. Now the ladders were already against the wall,
and the soldiery had not yet heard the signal, “ in their rage at what
they had suffered,'' as Appian says. ¹¹ But when the signal for recall
was given, the trusty soldier of Cyrus, although he was about to
smite an enemy with his uplifted sword‚ let him g0‚ and quietly with-
drew. “ He retired in quite a calm and orderly way,” writes Plutarch,
and he praises this deed recounted in the Cyropaedia. Why, ³“ the
man who has done a thing which his leader has forbidden, or the
man who has not followed his orders, is punished with death, even if
he has been successful.'’ And shall the man go unpunished who has
not respected the sovereign rights of the realm of our King, and
has done a thing forbidden there?

In this case, the Dutchman cannot say, “ I didn‘t see,’' for every-
body who was there did see, unless the heavy smoke from the guns
concealed from everyone the light of day. The Dutchman cannot
say, “I didn't think,'' ¹< for under the law of nations, which is well
known to everybody, domains are distinct, and everybody knows
that it is not lawful to commit such acts in foreign territory. There
is no greater deafness than the deafness of the man who purposely
does not wish to hear; no greater blindness than the blindness of
the man who avoids seeing. 1And this was the point in the jest of
Marius when he remarked that he “did not hear the law on account
of the clash of weapons.'' The jest was perpetrated; the bon mot
was made; made, too, was the bold and clever move of the Dutch-
man who once pursued a hostile French ship all the way to the city
of London. And this incident, too, is real enough.

But this is the question before us, whether the Spaniards may
ask the King for permission to cross to Belgium, whither they had
set out, under his royal safe conduct. Perhaps this question is rather
for the Royal Council than one which calls for advice by anyone of
us. Now, as Ι should say, the King can undoubtedly grant the peti-
tion, though there is the general remark in the law that ¹¹¹ “ permis-
sion does not imply obligation.’' n Many things are lawful that are
not expedient; 0 many things are lawful that are not honorable. Our
King can even avenge with considerable severity a wrong done to his
territory, and if he has Dutch ships under his control, he can detain
them until the Spaniards have come to a place of safety, pjust as
Syphax, whom we mentioned, kept back the Carthaginians, who were
lying in wait, until Scipio had sailed far enough to sea to be out of
danger—“ until Scipio reached safe water.’‘ The Carthaginians were
ambassadors also. ‘¹ Our doctors even teach us that if one has been
captured in a place where he ought not to have been captured,
he should even be allowed to make his way to a place of security
with such safeguards that pursuit would be difficult. This policy was
