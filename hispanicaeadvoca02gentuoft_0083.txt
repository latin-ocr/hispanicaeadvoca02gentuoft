The Pleas of a Spanislz Advocate, Bk. I. 55

either to permit of acquiring ownership by usucapticm, since the prop-
erty has not thereby come once more under the control of the owner,
even though it may now be claimed; and therefore the taint of theft
has not yet been removed; g possession must be gained by the [real]
owner and with full knowledge of the facts.

Thus the interpretation of the law which I have quoted makes
it clear that the traders did not acquire a lawful title to this mer-
chandise, even though they bought it back from the Berbers them-
selves; for it is likewise clear that the Berbers were brought into
the transaction for the simple reason that trade is not permitted in
that country, except through the medium of some official of the
treasury. Accordingly this person would give an empty appearance
of regularity‚ while the substance of the contract was with the
pirates. ¹¹ On this question, however, Ayala opposes us; in the case
of the slave he admits our interpretation on the score of postliminium,
but not in other cases where postliminium does not exist. But one
should note the general intent of the law which has in view anything
which may have been stolen. iLikewise‚ there is postliminium in the
case of other things, too, if they enter the country in a lawful man-
ner. And as to Ayala's added statement that unquestionably this
property became the enemy’s, and that therefore the original owner
lost his ownership‚ Socinus, as I said, denies this unquestionableness.
But let us grant its unquestionableness for the sake of argument.
Does it follow, likewise‚ that the property does not revert to its
original condition? And yet this is the question now before us.
¹³ “ If the enemy have taken from an island a man who had been exiled
there, that man, if ransomed, no matter what chance leads to his
return, will assume the position which he would have assumed if he
had not been taken away.'’ This is the law as the glossator expounds
it in regard to our case, that no one by any chance may criticize me
for speaking somewhat aside from the point. In the third place,
Ayala writes that the Atinian law has to do with citizens, not with
enemies. But this, too, has no bearing on our present case, which
has to do, not with mermes, but with friends and allies who bought
back Spanish property from the enemy. Then, too, Ayala himself
feels the emptiness of this argument of his. and accordingly writes
modestly that everyone should use his own judgment here. At least, he
considers this concession perfectly fair, that action against these
possessors shall be taken not otherwise than if the thief or his heirs
are insolvent. But this is another question, although here, t00‚
the interpretation would favor the Spaniards, since the pirates
own absolutely nothing. For these reasons we are justified in con-
cluding that the merchants did not secure a legal claim to the prop-
erty and that it should be restored to its Spanish owners.
