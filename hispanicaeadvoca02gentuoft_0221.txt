CHAPTER XVI

Of an Appeal from an [ηῗνξοειὲῐονγ Βεενεε, and of Revision
0 tte ame

Appeal was taken when the judge had admitted certain people
who came as third parties to delay a res iudicata between otherS. At
the same time also petition was made to the Prince for a revision of
this admission. Consequently, two points must be looked into: 189
whether it is lawful to appeal, and whether it is lawful to ask for a

reV1S1on.
Now, the first question would not be diffizcult, ὃ since it is said to

be “quite true and an undoubted fact '' that it is lawful in an action
for possession, as this one is, to appeal against any irreparable injury
whatsoever, done before the verdict has been given. b A thoroughly
prudent judge will decide that there is a just and reasonable cause
for admitting an appeal from an interlocutory decree, when he sees
that a loss caused by an interlocutory decree cannot be repaired by
a definitive decree. This is the teaching of Menochius, and an inter-
locutory decree which deals with the admission of persons involves
such an injury. ⁰ Consequently, appeal from it is allowed by Specu-
lator, {Johannes Andreae, Baldus in a very full discussion, Angelus,
Romanus, and others cited by Menochius and Contardus, and still
others, as well as by these two writers, Menochius and Contardus.
No one whom Ι know holds a different opinion, with the single ex-
ception of Jason, and, in the single case of admitting witnesses, Ful-
gosius. Now, Jason, just as he mocks at the opinion of Speculator,
which everybody accepts, so in my opinion improperly cites Ful-
gosius as opposing the others on the general principle. Howeyer,
these are the words of Fulgosius: (Ν From an interlocutory decree
an appeal may be taken, when by it prejudice would be done which
cannot be repaired by a definitive decree, and Angelus says that
Speculator holds that if an interlocutory decree of a judge shall have
ruled that some witness ought to have been admitted, who ought not
to have been, one may appeal even under the civil law. He also
teaches that the doctrine holds as a general principle when by an in-
terlocutory decree anyone is declared to have a legal standing who
has not. But what he says about a witness does not seem to involve
an injury which may not be repaired by a definitive decree, as. t'or
instance, if he had made a wrong decision based on the depositions
