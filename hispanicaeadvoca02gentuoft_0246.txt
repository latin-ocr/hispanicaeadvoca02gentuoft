CHAPTER XXI
Of the Same Matter
TO HIS WORSHIP, THE JUDGE

I said that permission should be given to sell the sugar, because
it cannot be preserved in its natural excellence beyond three years.
What need have we here of witnesses, when we have the plain state-
ment of the laws and of all the commentators? It cannot be kept
beyond three years, and it should be possible to keep it beyond three
years to prevent this permission from being given. Thus everyone
says, “ beyond three years.‘' Up to three years would not be enough.
But let me say, your WVorship, that that which does not keep beyond
three years deteriorates even after one day, for the disintegration sets
in gradually, just as forgetfulness sets in gradually (forgetfulness is
a sort of disintegration), and what is not found in the memory
after a year is less in amount even after one day, Augustine wisely
says. Accordingly, sugar becomes worse day by day if it is kept, not
merely month by month and year by year, and, consequently, this
privilege should be granted.

And further, there should be no anxious and exact care about
the method of selling, if there is always the same result, namely,
that it is sold at as high a price as possible. A valuation reveals
this fair price. It may be made by the judge, by experts, or by
public auction, not by public auction alone, as the opposing side
would like to have it here. But the doctors note other methods too
of a similar kind. Besides, according to those Commentators, public
auction is not without its own perils and frauds. The ambassador
shrinks from a public auction, because a certain amount of disgrace
would, so it seems, be brought upon him and upon the owners of the
sugar by a public auction and the voice of the auctioneer. What hon-
orable and respectable man sells his property in this way? The
ambassador shrinks from a public auction and seeks to have permis-
sion to sell granted him, not to have the necessity of selling imposed
upon him, not to be hurried into selling straightway or into having
immediate recourse to a public auction. He wishes to sell to recoup
himself for necessary expenses on the wares themselves, for duty
and for various other things. He shrinks now from a public auction,
because he does not wish or think it fair to have to give up the valua-
tion already made. For the valuation he is responsible to the oppos-

ing side. There is no thought of change. Upon the real owners
