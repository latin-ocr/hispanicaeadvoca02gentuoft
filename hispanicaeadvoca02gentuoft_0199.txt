The Pleas of a Spanislz Advocate, Bk. II. 171

most of the material in Gregory, the author of that chapter, is taken
from the civil law.

¹¹ Furthermore, Ι add that his rights pass from the principal‚ and
do not return to him. For instance, Hostiensis and Baldus remark
in this connection that a verdict pronounced in a case where a secon-
dary owner appears does not take notice of the principal, although
a judgment given in his favor would benefit the secondary owner,
because the right in this case would pass downward5‚ not upwards.
Baldus also writes that what is found in 1. saepe ² should be added.
This law has cases, which, playing the part of rules, show where
a res judicata between certain people injures others. They show
that it is necessary in this situation to have the right of the third
party emanate from the litigant, for the case in this law, when
“the debtor has suffered the creditor to go to law concerning the
ownership of a pledge ” would not stand in our way. It shows rather
that it is not necessary to have the right of a third party come
from a litigant, just as the right of a debtor in a case where the
ownership of a pledge is involved does not come from a creditor
who is a litigant. iThe case would not stand in the way, says
Covarruvias, because in the Florentine books a different reading
appears, viz„ when “the creditor has suffered the debtor to go to
law.'’ He mentions in addition Albericus, Comanus, Alexander, and
others who approve the Florentine reading, and disapprove the other.
kI mention also Duarenus, who writes that the Florentine reading
seems to him the more correct. There is Cujacius also, who defends
the same reading from the books of the Basilica‚2 and says that
this reading in the law is now accepted “by everybody.'' Donellus
also supports it, in commenting on this law. ¹Even the very learned
Laderchius approves it in his responses. Pray, what need is there
of explaining in general the authority of these books? mElse- 168
where I too have spoken on this subject. ¹³ Resides, Socinus remarks
that it would be hard to think of departing from the original
text (he is talking of the Florentine text). Even if that case were
not there, Alexander and Covarruvias actually reach the conclusion
that the view is not correct, that a verdict pronounced against the
creditor may injure the debtor, because nowhere in the law and by
no method of reasoning could it be proved. In point of fact, others
seem to have been led to form this opinion, that a creditor may
prejudice a debtor, on no other ground than that furnished by
l. saepe, although they have collected abundant evidence later, on
which to bolster up this opinion, so that what Cujacius has most
excellently said would apply here: 0“The edition of the Floren-
tine Pandects has fortunately taught students of law the correctness
