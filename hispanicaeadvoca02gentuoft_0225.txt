matter if we do say that even the wisest men are deceived in regard
to facts.

The fourth point does not create a difficulty, gg because the stay
and review, granted by the interlocutory decree, of the execution
would cause no small prejudice. The Spanish ambassador would have
a very just reason for action. He has failed to ask to have judges
associated with a judge who is under serious suspicion: indeed, he has
not rejected a hostile judge, hh and he had the right even on this
score to reject him in every case, because in one case an appeal from
him was pending. Or if under the civil law, which we are following
in this court of the admiralty, this is not the case, or if the civil law
takes another attitude than the canon law, and we should not have
that right, at all events we have the right to associate judgeS, and not
to have asked for them could be an error on the part of the ambas-
sador. He had a judge who was under suspicion, and he took care to
have him warned by the supreme council of our King, but he made a
mistake, because he trusted the authority of the council more than he
feared the hostile, irritated temper of the judge. iiA revision is
granted even when an error is attributed to him who asks revision.
Thus the fourth argument also on the other side is refuted. What is
said above of a delay for a comparatively short time counts for
nothing in this case where the question is not one of time.

The fifth argument presents no difficulty, because in reality in
this case petition was made in writing. The ambassador gave to the
King in writing a summary of the whole procedure3 he gave a letter
to the King: he petitioned the King, in the form in which an ambas-
sador should petition a King. kkAccording to the standing of the
persons concerned these matters are transacted‚ as Rebuffus well puts
it in this treatise on the subject of petitions. He adds too that oral
petitions are of as much weight as written ones3 and that the same
is true of appeals. 1¹ Now, if in the case of an appeal from an inter-
locutory decree a document is not necessary, as the common opinion
stands, and as is undoubtedly true under the civil laxv, no strong
reason will be given why one should be necessary in the case of a
petition.

The sixth argument presents no difficulty, “¹¹³³ because in point of
fact a verdict pronounced after an appeal from an interlocutory
decree will not be turned over for execution, while the appeal is
pending, for the validity of the verdict too depends on the outcome
of the interlocutory decree. Manifestly, if the appeal from the in-
terlocutory decree held, the definitive decree did not. since it was
pronounced by a judge whose jurisdiction had been suspended. as
Panormitanus well puts it. The case is not even injured by the fact
that the judge from whose interlocutory decree an appeal has been
