made by the individual were made with no intent to introduce a
change3 which is not presumed, unless this is expressly the point taken
into consideration. The rather should this expression be considered
superfluous than that a departure from the law was contemplated.
And other arguments which are read everywhere in all the doctors—
these arguments I have read in Cravetta and Cephalus. The latter
makes the statement—striking, from our point of view—that,
however the case may be in contracts made according to strict law,
in those implying good saith, the case is entirely as I have said in
view of the presumption of perfect good faith. dNow, a contract
involving a lease or a commission does imply good faith, θ and all
contracts that come under the law of nations are of this character;
f and, therefore, a contract involving a lease certainly comes under
the law of nations as does one involving a commission‚ gif all im-
plying good faith come under the law of nations‚ and a commission
certainly implies good faith.

Then consider the fact that our countrymen made the contract
in this case with a prince, h for contracts with princes, as everyone
knows, all imply good faith. Yet why, pray, do we talk of any con-
tract here where the Tuscan took over the ship by requisition and
did everything else by requisition? iThe one who obeys the requisi-
tion of a master is not thought of as acting of his own free will.
Thus, there is no force in the second objection, based on the nature
of leasing, because we have a commission here, kin which case he
who gives the commission makes good any accident and damages to
the person who takes the commission‚ and he who was not held by
any obligation recovers all these things, as Salycetus explainS, in the
greatest detail of all writers.

Now, all these considerations are not affected by the agreement
regarding hire which constitutes a leasing, as Panormitanus notes,
because when he speaks thus it is of those who “ come ” for hire;
he does not make a statement to apply to our people who were sent
by the Tuscan under compulsion3 yea, whose ship was sent under
compulsion. Pennensis likewise gave this reply regarding those act·
ing against their will in such a case. ¹Further, this subsidiary con-
tract is said to be part of another, the principal one, and accordingly
it has the same legal standing as the principal contract, even though
it would per se have another legal standing. m This procedure is the
more equitable and beneficent and should be followed where things
forming a whole are concerned.

If this ship was lost through the fault, however slight, of the
trustee or his men, it is unquestionably true that the person who gave
the commission will be responsible, as we find in Panormitanus whom
I have mentioned and in Hostiensis. And here it is believed there
