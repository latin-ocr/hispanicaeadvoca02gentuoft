p A verdict which is null and void cannot be confirmed. Furthermore,
a subsequent verdict‚ which has confirmed the one mentioned, is null
and void, and that point about the error in the marks is not the only
one which renders this verdict null and void, as has been said. His

Lordship‚ our judge, who is an ordinary judge, clearly like an ordi-
nary judge, can take this matter up for judgment again, and conse-

quendy, he may take it up again. But let him listen to us if he does
not wish again to make a decision which is null and void. qAn
exceptIOn, based on nullity, is not properly an exception. Therefore‚
it is always offered in opposstion, even when every exception is for-
bidden, and no preceding decree strengthens it, nor does the confession
of a party concerned‚ although the efficacy of a confession is so great
that a judge may lawfully pass from any stupid process of law what-
ever to any penalty whatsoever, even to the penalty of death.
