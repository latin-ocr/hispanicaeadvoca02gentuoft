li·s‹·-n1‹1jcs!‹³, because of the public violence involved. Then,.too,.the
remarks of Mynsingerus have to do with different territories‚ 1t 1s
truc. but still with territories united in one whole, namely‚ the German
Empire. It is reckoned as one territory, so far as the Emperor himself
is concerned, ¹< as the doctors remark in similar cases.

Now Cephalus replies in various ways to the objection that
the starting-point ought to be considered, and that according
to all authorities the starting-point is lawful when we find the same
authority in control throughout, so that, if the beginning and the end
are in the same territory, etc. ¹An offender, for example, if he flees
into a church is safe, as at least the more correct and commonly
accepted opinion goes, the opinion sanctioned by usage and confirmed
quite recently in important cases. Covarruvias states that he does
not see the reasoning by which the opposite view can be defended.
Therefore, if he does not draw that inference concerning the lawful
starting-point in the case of the church‚ he will be less inclined to
draw it in the case of a territory, ¹¹¹ for the church is within the ter-
ritory of a lay magistrate. Therefore, the distinctive right and
privilege of a church is that immunity which I have mentioned.

ῃΙ know that there are some who teach that whether a place
is exempt or outside a territory makes no difference, but I know
that at the same time it is said that this doctrine involves great
peril: nay, that it is false. 0 To be outside a territory is to be entirely
in foreign parts; to be exempt is not the same. Accordingly, the
reply has been given that while common consent may support the
judge who grants an exemption, it is not true that foreign territory
may be violated, and the reason given is that a thing easily resumes
its natural character. So a church may easily resume its original
non-exempt character. pBesides, this privilege of the church is
prejudicial and opposed to the public interest, when that interest
demands the apprehension and punishment of the guilty, and when
it is simply a question of liberating a crimina] in a church. That
privilege is always opposed to the theory of the common law. But
in the case of an enemy and the territory of another, the common
law, making distinction of territorieS, assumes a favorable aspect;
‘¹ it is more compelling and harder to break. Furthermore‚ in this
case the question concerns one who is unfortunate and a freeman; in
the case of the church, it often concerns a man who is convicted and
sentenccd to punishment. Therefore, if that doctrine holds in the
case of the church‚ in the case of a territory it is the more valid;
the simiation is entirely the same.

Thus I have replied also to the arguments on the other side
which Ι have mentioned above. Γ ΤΟ that first argument, with refer-
ence to another's field, Socinus replies that an interdict on hunting
