To his most illustr-ious and excellent Lordship‚
” Don Baltasar de Zzisziqa,

Counselor to the Privy Council of His Catholic lllajesty and
Ambassador at the Cozcrt of His Imperial Majesty,

Scipione Gentili sends 'many qreetinqs.

What my brother, Alberico Gentili‚ had himself planned
to do, had he lived, that, at his death, in his will he instructed
me to do, Now, although he had given instructions to have all
the numerous commentaries on the Civil Law which he left be-
hind him suppressed or destroyed, he made an exception of this
one book, which he wished me to edit, because it was more

contains discussions of those controversies which Spaniards and
other subjects of His Catholic Majesty carried on in the kingdom
of England with foreigners, and forthe mostpart‚with the Dutch,
beginning with the time when the most serene and wise King‚
James I, ascended the throne of that most flourishing realm.
After he had made peace with Spain and signed treaties, although
he WaS‚ so to speak, an intermediary between two na'tions which
were divided by a very bitter and almost internecine war, still
he remained the friend and ally of both. Consequently, he could
not help allowing the controversies and quarrels which these
peoples had referred to him to be settled in accordance with
the principles of law and equity. Not all of thern are private
cases, or cases pertaining to private citizens only, but some of
them are also of 'a public nature, for they deal with the law of
war and the law governing kingdoms and treaties. Charge of
all these matters and care for his Spanish fellow-citizens neces-
sarily rested on the man who acted in England at that time as
ambassador in the name of your Catholic King.

The ambassador at that time was your kinsman‚ the most
illustrious and excellent Don Pedro de Zufiiga, a man who sur-

passed his ancestors' in the distinction which caused your family
