ferred possession or ownership‚ for it would be interpreted according
to the nature of a contract‚ with an unqualified condition. Although
the character of the condition may be modified with the consent of the
parties concerned, still that is the case when there is an explicit state-
ment, not if the clause of the agreement is posited absolutely, for the
general clause would not modify a condition arising from the nature
of the contract. ³In like manner a clause of an agreement would
have no effect, when there is uncertainty on the score of place and
quantity, as there is here.

Yet against these conclusions Decius remarks that, although what
has been said concerning an agreement may be true, still a transfer
of the property in accordance with the agreement has the effect of
measurement, so that the risk is transferred and the sale becomes
complete, not because the implied condition of measurement is done
away with, but by the transfer the result which is obtained by
measurement is more fully accomplished, for when a transfer has
been made, ownership changes hands, and the buyer assumes the
risk, because he is found to be the owner. 4 Similarly, measurement,
even when a transfer of the property has not taken place, transfers
the risk, because owing to the measurement the thing is clearly seen
to be sold according to bulk, and for the thing sold in bulk, although
not transferred, the risk is the buyer’s at once. However, the corn-
pleteness would be greater from the transfer of ownership than
from the transfer of risk. Now, if measurement leads to a transfer
of the risk, a transfer of the property will have the same effect more
surely. Finally, what is said concerning the positing of a clause abso-
lutely is true of an unexplicit clause, because a general clause would
be determined in accordance with what precedes3 still here there is a
special clause, sufficient for the purpose, as has been said. nThis is
from Decius.

OSimilarly both Parisius and Cephalus say that if any transfer
whatever of property has taken place, even by agreement, the fact
that measurement has not been made would do no harm, because,
in accordance with the conditional contract‚ ownership would be
transferred, although the condition were not yet satisfied‚ provided
the condition be included. Cephalus cites other authorities also
to the effect that even such a contract is called conditional as to
the risk involved in the article, not as to other effects, when a transfer
of the property has taken place, for he to whom the property has
been transferred will seek the benefits of it, and, therefore, will be
held to the resulting responsibilities. Consult Cephalus. Even in
selling a thing which is regularly tested by tasting, the condition is
