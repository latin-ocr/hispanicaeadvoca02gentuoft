CHAPTER VIII
Of the Protection of Sea-Territory

The Dutch made a strong protest because they were being inter-
cepted on the high seas by an officer of the King and made to halt
on the high seas with the booty which they had taken from their
enemies, the Spaniards. They maintained that the violence was un-
justified; that they had been embarrassed and robbed‚ and deserved
compensation; and finally, that owing to this treatment they had a
plea to urge against the Spaniards likewise, who, though captive, were
being released in this way along with their captured property.

³ But Ι urged in rebuttal what I once wrote in my books on war,
i.e.‚ that the word territory was applied equally to land and to water.
¹³ “ Now the doctors say it is maintained that the lordly Venetians, the
Genoese, and others possessing a port have jurisdiction and sov-
ereignty over all the sea adjoining them for a distance of one hun-
dred miles, or even farther‚ if they are not near another state. And
thus the lordly Venetians are able to inflict punishment upon the
pirates captured there. And this Bartolus says was the practice of
the Pisans in his time on his advice and on that of the famous Fran-
ciscus Tigrinus.” cAnd this is the view of Bartolus regarding those
one hundred miles, even though it be said that the sea is common.
So say the rest unhesitatingly, if you except comanus, that obstinate
man. And you see how the sway of our King extends far toward the
south, the north, and the west. <¹ “ The northern coast of Britain, since
no land lies off it, is exposed to the vast and open main.’' Then, too,
the southern coast of Ireland extends toward Spain; the western, to-
ward the Indian realms of Spain. And thus, immeasurable is the broad
jurisdiction of our King upon the sea. Nor is this jurisdiction main-
tained by the enforcement of a certain royal edict in which certain
boundaries are laid down, beyond which the King refuses to have his
territorial power extended in connection with these acts of war be-
tween the Spaniards and the Dutch.

Now, it is claimed that the Dutch were intercepted by an officer
outside of these boundaries. For by a late treaty of peace between our
King and the King of Spain, each is bound to protect the subjects of the
other anywhere within his territories. Consequently, each of them
is bound to afford protection throughout that far-extending jurisdic-

tion. eThere are, forsooth, limits laid down by right, just as there
