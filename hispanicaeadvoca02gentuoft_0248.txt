CHAPTER XXII

A Letter to a Theoloqian, a Leqate of the Char-ch, Urqes That the
Contested Property Be Sold

If Ι were able to come myself, I should not be writing this letter
to you; for letters do not make answer if any exception is taken in
favor of the other side; while Ι myself should make reply, if I were
saying anything in your presence and it did not in your clear judg-
ment seem sufficiently well grounded. But it so happens that Ι am
forced to stay at home owing to ill health. You, therefore, in your
kindness will read and with your learning will examine my view,
which I am writing or rather dictating, on the former chapter (since
there is agreement regarding the latter) with reference to holding a
sale.

A useful thing is the conservation of the good on hand, or the
securing of the good not on hand, or the warding off or prevention
of the evil, as Aristode, or someone else, the author of the ‘⁶ Rhetoric

for my part think, and Ι think that Ι do not think badly. You, how-
ever,—pray, let me say it—will decide by far the most wisely. The
judge's decision was that the ambassador not only was in possession
of the goods, but should be kept in possession of them. Now, if
my opponents—I speak the literal truth-—should bring an action for
recovery, by this same action, they will in a short space of time, in
three days or three hours be restored to possession.

We have won many things so far in this case by good fortune,
or perhaps through the culpable negligence of our opponent, even
because he did not urge making a new valuation, to give rise to fresh
delays, as he might have done most neatly,1 either on the ground
that a valuation never becomes an award, or because, having been
made previ0usly, it was made for another purpose. Then, too, he
does not insist upon the accepting of new bondsmen‚ as he might very
well have done, for those appointed formerly, when the property was
not to be bartered off, are not held to their bond now that the sale of
the property has been made permissible by the award of the judge.
Then, too, he might have appealed from this award, since the afore-
said action for recovery was to follow in a short time and, in conse-
